Explanation of CSV Output Columns
=========================================

1. keyword_freq_long.csv
-------------------------
This file is in "long format," meaning each row represents one bank-year-keyword.

Columns:
- bank        → Name of the bank (from PDF filename, e.g., CIMB).
- year        → Year of the report (from PDF filename, e.g., 2019).
- group       → Category of keyword:
                  • FTII = FinTech Input Index (technology terms such as AI, blockchain, big data).
                  • FTOI = FinTech Output Index (innovation terms such as mobile banking, online payment).
- keyword     → The actual keyword/phrase being counted (e.g., "ai", "mobile banking").
- count       → How many times this keyword appears in the document.
- rel_freq    → Relative frequency = count ÷ total words in the document. 
                This normalizes results so longer documents don’t dominate.
- colname     → Combined identifier used for pivoting (e.g., "FTII__ai"). 
                Useful when transforming into wide format.

2. keyword_freq_wide.csv
-------------------------
This file is in "wide format," meaning each row represents one bank-year, 
with columns for all keywords.

Columns:
- bank        → Name of the bank.
- year        → Year of the report.
- FTII__...   → Relative frequency for each FTII keyword.
                Example: FTII__ai = relative frequency of "ai".
- FTOI__...   → Relative frequency for each FTOI keyword.
                Example: FTOI__mobile banking = relative frequency of "mobile banking".

Notes:
- All keyword columns contain relative frequencies (values are usually very small, e.g., 0.00005). 
- Small values are expected, because annual reports often have tens of thousands of words.
- Long format is better for detailed keyword analysis.
- Wide format is better for building indices or dashboards.

=========================================
In summary:
- Use keyword_freq_long.csv for detailed analysis per keyword.
- Use keyword_freq_wide.csv when you need a compact table with one row per bank-year.
