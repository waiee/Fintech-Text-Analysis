PROJECT: The Impact of Fintech Innovation on Bank Performance
Step-by-step explanation of methodology

------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 1 — Data Collection
Purpose:
- Gather annual reports of banks and financial performance data.
How do we do it:
- Download annual reports (PDFs) from banks’ websites or regulators.
- Collect bank-level financial data (ROA, ROE, Assets, CAR, etc.) from reports or databases.

------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 2 — Text Extraction
Purpose:
- Convert annual reports (PDFs) into machine-readable text.
How do we do it:
- Use a PDF parser (e.g., PyPDF2) to extract text content.
- Save the extracted text along with bank and year identifiers.

------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 3 — Keyword Dictionary
Purpose:
- Define what “Fintech” terms we want to measure in the text.
How do we do it:
- Build two dictionaries:
  FTII = Fintech Input Index (tech terms: AI, blockchain, cloud, big data, etc.)
  FTOI = Fintech Output Index (innovation terms: online banking, digital wallet, mobile payment, etc.)
- These terms represent the presence of fintech-related content in the reports.

------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 4 — Text Preprocessing
Purpose:
- Clean the text so keyword search is accurate.
How do we do it:
- Lowercase all text.
- Remove line breaks, hyphenated word splits, and extra spaces.
- Add a word count for each document (used for normalization).

------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 5 — Keyword Frequency Calculation
Purpose:
- Count how often fintech terms appear in each report.
How do we do it:
- Search for each keyword/phrase in the cleaned text.
- Record:
  count = how many times it appears.
  rel_freq = count divided by total word count (to adjust for report length).
- Save frequencies in long and wide formats.

------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 6 — Min–Max Normalization
Purpose:
- Put all keyword frequencies on a common scale.
How do we do it:
- For each keyword, scale its rel_freq across all documents to [0, 1].
- Formula: (value - min) / (max - min).
- Ensures that common and rare terms are comparable.

------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 7 — Entropy Weighting
Purpose:
- Give more weight to keywords that carry more information.
How do we do it:
- Compute entropy for each keyword (measures how evenly it is distributed across banks/years).
- If a term appears everywhere, entropy is high → low weight.
- If a term appears unevenly, entropy is low → high weight.
- Normalize weights so they sum to 1 within each group (FTII, FTOI).

------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 8 — Index Construction (FTII, FTOI, FTI)
Purpose:
- Build composite indices that summarize fintech intensity.
How do we do it:
- For each bank-year:
  FTII = weighted sum of normalized input keywords.
  FTOI = weighted sum of normalized output keywords.
  FTI  = FTII + FTOI (overall fintech index).
- Save results as both long and wide tables.

------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 9 — Assemble Analysis Dataset
Purpose:
- Combine fintech indices with financial performance data.
How do we do it:
- Load bank financials (ROA, ROE, Assets, CAR, etc.).
- Merge with FTII/FTOI/FTI by bank and year.
- Create one analysis-ready dataset for regression.

------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 10 — Regression Analysis
Purpose:
- Test the impact of fintech indices on bank performance.
How do we do it:
- Dependent variable: ROA.
- Independent variables: FTII, FTOI, or FTI.
- Controls: ROE, Assets, CAR, etc.
- Estimate different models:
  • Pooled OLS
  • Fixed Effects (FE)
  • Random Effects (RE)
  • PCSE (Panel-Corrected Standard Errors)

------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 11 — Diagnostics & Robustness
Purpose:
- Validate the models and check assumptions.
How do we do it:
- Compute descriptive statistics and correlations.
- Check multicollinearity (VIF).
- Perform Hausman test to choose between FE and RE.
- Compare results under different weighting schemes (equal weights vs entropy).
