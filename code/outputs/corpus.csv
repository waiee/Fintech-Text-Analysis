including the Group’s business pillars and support sectors, key subsidiaries and international operations. The risks, opportunities and outcomes of our principal activities and operations are covered in detail on pages 86 to 100. 
The period covered in this report is from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023 (Financial Year 
2023) unless otherwise stated. Financial information has been prepared in accordance with the Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards (MFRS) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Any significant restatements of data from previous years are noted in the respective sections.
REPORTING BOUNDARY
Statutory reporting boundary
The value creation, preservation and erosion process impacting our six capitals  
is covered in this report, with the outcomes documented by stakeholders  
as indicated below:
OUR PROCESS DISCLOSURES
A dedicated reporting team has studied the requirements of the Integrated Reporting <IR> approach and conducted content planning in determining the matters that are integral for 
the preparation of this report. Information included in this report has been gathered from internal and external stakeholders. The suite of reports has been prepared based on the statutory provisions, best practices, policies and guidelines established by the relevant governing and regulatory bodies (itemised by each report on page 2). These reports undergo a validation process for assurance as explained in detail below. Thereafter, the validity and suitability of the content and all issues considered material are reviewed, finalised and approved by the Board.
ASSURANCE
Internal assurance is provided through the alignment of the Group’s risk, audit and compliance functions. This allows for dedicated monitoring and oversight, ensuring a robust reporting process is in place and the integrity of information disclosed. The Group’s Risk Governance Structure places accountability and ownership in ensuring an appropriate level of independence and segregation of duties between the three lines of defence. More information can be found on page 140. 
The Group’s annual financial statements were audited by our external auditor, Ernst & Young 
PLT. Limited assurance by SIRIM QAS International Sdn. Bhd. was provided for the Group’s Sustainability Report, Environmental Report and sustainability-related chapters (i.e.: Sustainability Material Matters and Sustainability Statement) in the IAR while limited assurance on sustainable finance achievements was provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers PLT, Malaysia.
MATERIALITY
We assess what information should be reported in our IAR based on the principle of materiality. This report discloses our risks, opportunities, macrotrends and other considerations that impact materiality on our six capitals and our ability to create, preserve and minimise erosion of value for our stakeholders. We conduct a materiality assessment (refer to page 36) on key topics deemed pertinent to both internal and external stakeholders covering five areas including governance, environment, employees, society and products and services. This materiality assessment helps shape our long-term strategy and execution of our business model to create value-added outcomes for all stakeholders.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This report contains certain forward-looking statements about Maybank’s future strategy, performance, operations and prospects. These statements and expectations carry risks and uncertainties given that they are dependent on circumstances that will take place in the future. As such, these factors may cause actual results or developments to deviate materially from Maybank’s forward-looking statements made at the time of release of our FY2023 results. Maybank makes no representations or warranty, express or implied, that these forward-looking statements will be achieved. Undue reliance should not be placed on such statements and Maybank will not assume responsibility for any loss or damage by any party arising from reliance of these statements.

Statement
Guided by M25+, we overcame all 
the challenges that surfaced, surpassing industry performance to achieve another record-breaking year with total assets exceeding RM1 trillion and a net profit of RM9.35 billion. 
Tan Sri Dato’ Sri Ir. Zamzamzairani Mohd Isa
Chairman
Dividend payout of
RM7.24 
billion2023 was a year in which we were 
reminded of how fragile the   
world is socially, economically and environmentally. Although COVID-19 was no longer a pandemic, we continued to experience its lingering effects. At the same time, geopolitical tensions continued to simmer, commodity prices were volatile, and inflation impacted the quality of life for many. Before the close of the  
year, COP28 underlined the urgency of managing climate change. In  
other words, it was a challenging 12  
months for everyone – governments, corporations and communities alike. 
Yet, Maybank was prepared for it. After much 
soul-searching inspired by our incoming President and Group Chief Executive Officer in 2022, we had outlined a new M25+ strategy which takes into consideration changes that are reshaping our operating landscape, and how these would affect the Bank. Although Maybank already recognised that our success depends largely on the well-being of our stakeholders, M25+ further emphasises the creation of stakeholder value, not only through a customer-centric mindset but also a more pervasive adoption of Islamic principles, as well as intensified sustainability initiatives. The objective, through this strategy, is for value-based banking to become part of Maybank’s identity, differentiating us from others in the industry.Become a global

pg. 151-160
15 Guided by M25+, we overcame all the challenges that surfaced to make significant 
advances in every aspect of our operations in 2023. Resourceful and resilient, we surpassed industry performance to achieve another record-breaking year with total assets exceeding RM1 trillion and a net profit of RM9.35 billion, a new historical high. That these results were achieved along with a strengthened environmental, social and governance (ESG) base made them even more meaningful.
TAKING THE LEAD IN ISLAMIC BANKING
The tenets of Islamic banking clearly reflect what we seek to achieve through the ethos of value-based banking, namely being fair and transparent in our dealings while enhancing our service delivery and contributing to financial inclusivity as well as social and environmental well-being. Arising from this coupled with Islamic finance business opportunities, Maybank seeks to become a global leader in Islamic banking. It gives me pleasure to share that we achieved a milestone in this regard in 2023, with the launch of a regional offshore Islamic wealth management (IWM) hub in Singapore.
Singapore was a strategic choice because it is a regional financial centre, and our IWM 
facility is the first-of-its-kind on the island state offering end-to-end IWM solutions. With support from Malaysia, we are confident that this new hub will grow rapidly as it serves the needs of individuals across the region looking to make investments that are socially and environmentally responsible.
Supporting our transformation into a premier Islamic financial institution, we have also 
established a Centre of Excellence which will ensure Shariah-compliant practices along our value chain – from the development of customer solutions to the delivery of the highest quality of service. In addition, our Centre of Excellence will build Maybank into a thought leader in advancing the Islamic financial sector.
Meanwhile, focusing more specifically on the environmental aspects of value-based 
banking, we have also introduced the “myimpact” brand and launched the first-of-its-kind myimpact credit cards in the region. Essentially, myimpact seeks to create greater awareness of how our everyday actions affect the environment, with the objective of promoting more sustainable lifestyles. With the card, members can track and offset their carbon footprints. They are also rewarded for the purchase of environmentally-friendly goods and services, and for contributing towards environmental efforts across the region. Following the card, we launched the myimpact SME hub, through which we seek to guide Malaysian small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to transition towards more sustainable practices by also offering them value-based solutions.
VALUE CREATION FOR OUR STAKEHOLDERS
As a result of our robust financial performance in 2023, Maybank has been able to continue to create value for our key stakeholders. We have a policy of distributing between 40% and 60% of our net profit to our shareholders; and it gives me pleasure to share that we once again exceeded our commitment by offering a fully-cash dividend payout ratio of 77.4%, or 60.0 sen per share. This is one of Maybank’s highest payouts ever and also one of the best dividend yields in the region for the year.In addition, we are contributing RM3.10 billion in taxes and zakat to the regional governments where we operate, which will be channelled towards socio-economic programmes aimed at bettering lives. At the same time, through Maybank Foundation, an accredited ASEAN entity since 2021, we continue to positively impact the communities we serve in the region. 
Education is one of the Foundation’s focus areas as it is a powerful enabler in uplifting 
marginalised communities. Through the Foundation, we offer two scholarships – the Maybank Group Scholarship, a more than five-decade-old programme for Malaysian students; and the newer ASEAN-Maybank Scholarship. This year, we awarded the Malaysian scholarship to 69 deserving students, providing them the opportunity to pursue tertiary education locally or overseas. We also selected five outstanding students from Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam for the ASEAN-Maybank Scholarship in conjunction with the 56
th ASEAN Day celebration in Indonesia. The ASEAN scholarship, developed in partnership 
with the ASEAN Secretariat, is unique because it not only provides the opportunity for students to pursue tertiary education, but also strengthens unity across the region as each scholar is placed in a regional university outside of his/her home country.
Other than the scholarship, Maybank Foundation organised the third Regional Capacity 
Building Workshop as part of the eMpowering Youths Across ASEAN (eYAA) programme together with the ASEAN Foundation. Since eYAA’s launch in 2018, over 200 youth volunteers have worked together with 30 social enterprises to positively impact the lives of over 50,000 individuals in the region.
Over and above these programmes, we champion financial inclusion and literacy via 
programmes such as Cashville Kidz, through which we have reached over 330,000 students across ASEAN. We also launched the regional Financial Education Excellence Awards to honour Cashville Kidz educators and students. We empower women and people with disabilities (PWDs) through Women Eco-Weavers and Reach Independence and Sustainable Entrepreneurship (R.I.S.E) respectively. Both programmes continued to grow in 2023: Women Eco-Weavers opened its second Maybank Silk Weaving Training Centre in Cambodia, or eighth centre in ASEAN, while R.I.S.E expanded to its fifth ASEAN country, Cambodia. In tiger conservation, our efforts with WWF-Malaysia in the Belum-Temenggor Forest Complex helped the Royal Belum State Park achieve the first CA|TS accreditation in ASEAN in 2023.
We undertake our community programmes out of a genuine desire to be a force for good. 
Nevertheless, it is always encouraging to receive recognition for our efforts; and this year it was a moment of pride when Maybank was awarded for Best CR Initiatives at the Edge Billion Ringgit Club 2023 awards in the Super Big Cap Companies category (for companies with above RM40 billion market capitalisation).

Our employees are one of our most important stakeholders, and we are dedicated to 
creating value for them too. In addition to competitive salaries and benefits, as well as continuous training and engagement activities, we nurture an inclusive and equitable environment within our workplace. Various policies are in place to ensure everyone in the Group is treated with respect and dignity including the recently launched Maybank Group Dignity Policy which enshrines our zero tolerance for discrimination, bullying, bias or harassment.
Meanwhile, as an equal opportunities employer and to further strengthen diversity at 
Maybank, we introduced the Work Placement Programme for PWDs. Our aim is to train differently abled talents for a minimum of eight months with the possibility of offering full-time employment to those who prove to be a good fit with our ethos. We currently have nearly 100 PWD trainees in various departments Group-wide.
DEEPENING OUR SUSTAINABILITY CAPABILITIES AND OUTCOMES
As we build our value-based identity, it is important that everyone at all levels in Maybank is on board our journey. Being aware of our aspirations is the first step; but to achieve our goals, all Maybankers need to have the knowledge and tools to ensure value creation across our operations. This has seen us continuously build our sustainability capabilities, especially in recent years. In 2023 itself, my colleagues on the Board and I attended various sustainability and climate-related training programmes including one on reporting the financial impacts of climate change, a topic which is pertinent as we support the low-carbon transition. We have also partnered with the United Nations Global Compact Network Malaysia & Brunei to develop a structured certification programme for sustainability practitioners within our workforce. At the ground level, we launched our inaugural Maybank Group Sustainability Week in 2023, which included panel sessions and talks on topics such as diversity and inclusion, mental health, sustainable farming and reducing carbon emissions. To encourage sustainability ideation among employees, we organised the Maybank Sustainability Ideathon, offering the winners funds to carry out proposed projects. It was encouraging to see very positive response to this initiative, with the five-day event drawing the participation of over 8,000 employees.
While the Sustainability Week was all-encompassing, the Group’s 11
th Global Corporate 
Responsibility Day was pervasive. The annual event saw more than 17,000 Maybankers 
engage directly with over 17,000 community members, making it one of the largest global community programmes undertaken in one day by a Malaysian-based corporation.
DRIVING GOVERNANCE AT THE BOARD
Good governance is critical to integrity and value creation; hence the Board continues to review and strengthen our governance framework as we adopt best practices. Among others, we have made a conscious effort to create diversity on the Board, with Directors bringing different experience and skillsets to enhance our perspectives and strategic decision-making capabilities. Women currently make up 36% of the Board, which is higher than the 30% baseline recommended by the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance. In addition, eight out of our 11 directors are independent, providing objective checks and balances and ensuring the interests of our stakeholders are protected at all times.
Two of my esteemed colleagues retired in 2023 while a new Director joined the Board. On 
behalf of the Board, I would like to express our appreciation for the invaluable contributions of Datuk R. Karunakaran, formerly our Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, and  
Cheng Kee Check, previously a Non-Independent Non-Executive Director, both of whom completed their nine-year tenures in 2023. I would also like to welcome Datuk Yee Yang Chien as our new Non-Independent Non-Executive Director. With his background in local and international financial institutions as well as leadership at MISC Berhad, Datuk Yee will be a valuable addition to the team.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Maybank’s sterling performance in 2023 is the cumulative result of the contributions and support of our external and internal stakeholders. The list includes the regulators and governments in each country where we operate, our extensive network of partners, our shareholders and customers. I would like to express my appreciation to these parties for contributing both tangibly and intangibly towards the creation of an ecosystem that has allowed Maybank to grow into the banking icon we are today. Additionally, I would like to express a heartfelt gratitude to all Maybankers for your unrelenting dedication to the Group and our mission of Humanising Financial Services. It is thanks to you that we have been able not only to excel as a bank, but now to go beyond as we create increasing value for the many lives that we touch.

All of this leaves no doubt in Maybank that ESG-related KPIs are as important as non-ESG KPIs.

pg. 151-160Chairman’s Statement It gives me great pleasure to present 
an overview of Maybank’s performance in 2023, which marked the first full year of my serving as President and Group CEO. It has been very encouraging to see our transformation programme M25+ gain traction, as reflected in our performance. This is the result of a great deal of hard work that has gone into its execution, with contributions from the entire team, including my Group Executive Committee (EXCO) colleagues and all fellow Maybankers, guided and supported by the Board of Directors. The year was not without challenges, yet we remained resolute and stayed the course, adapting and advancing the Agile ways of working.
Although fears of a global recession did not 
materialise, economic growth was muted in 2023, with interest rate hikes by the United States (US)’s Federal Reserve to curb decades-high inflation which cascaded into a pervasive cost-of-living impact and tightening financial conditions. Added to this, geopolitical tensions intensified with no let-up in the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Gaza conflict erupting in the last quarter of the year. Amid these socio-economic and geopolitical challenges, the International Monetary Fund predicted continued slowing down of global economic growth in 2023 to 3.1%, from 3.5% in 2022 and 6.0% in 2021, when developed nations lifted their COVID-19 restrictions.President and

18 For corporations, the business environment is further complicated by changing behavioural 
patterns and consumer expectations. Whereas before, only the young and tech savvy opted to carry out daily transactions online, today almost everyone has transitioned onto the digital platform because of the convenience. This has stimulated the proliferation of tech start-ups in every sphere leading to fintechs posing a real threat to conventional banks that are not quick on the digital uptake. Competition in the industry is intensifying not only from these non-bank entities but also from bigger and more established regional players.
In the current volatile and unpredictable flux, Maybank has not just stayed our ground; we 
continue to strengthen our leadership in various key areas. Our steady growth is mainly the result of having always maintained a pulse on the changes around us and evolving in tandem with shifting trends as these emerge.
M25+ STRATEGY FOR SUSTAINED GROWTH
Last year, I mentioned how I had worked with my EXCO colleagues to outline our refined strategy, M25+, to renew our DNA at Maybank by adopting Agile@Scale to enhance collaboration as well as rapid ideation based on customers’ journeys to differentiate our solutions and propositions, futureproofing the Group. This year, I’m pleased to share that we are seeing results from this strategy which is anchored on five strategic thrusts: Intensify Customer-centricity, Accelerate Digitalisation and Technology Modernisation, Strengthen Maybank’s Position Beyond Malaysia, Drive Leadership in Sustainability Agenda, and Achieve True Global Leadership in Islamic Banking. A total of 12 strategic programmes (SPs) were developed towards the attainment of goals set under these strategic thrusts and we have made good progress in all initiatives undertaken – especially the focus on enhancing customers’ journeys and improving our productivity.
Recognising customers’ increasing expectations of service providers, we have worked 
intently on driving customer-centricity leveraging next-gen technologies and analytics. The idea is to curate hyper-personalised solutions – not just in banking, but beyond banking – in order to win customers’ trust and their long-term loyalty. To empower our customers  
and enable them to fulfil their journeys, we are investing about 77% of our M25+ budget of up to RM4.5 billion specifically on building our front-end digital solutions, Tech-for-Business, and back-end technology infrastructure, Tech-For-Tech, to provide hyper-personalised solutions and drive our overall business. Thus far, we have committed RM577 million in investments for M25+, of which 87% is for Tech-for-Business and 10% for Tech-for-Tech.
Advancing our digitalisation journey, we introduced a number of digital solutions catering to 
a wide section of our customers. Key among these was the e-KYC CASA account opening enabling customers to open accounts without having to visit a physical branch. For Retail SME customers, we simplified the loan application process by making available digital financing in more countries such as Singapore and Cambodia, in addition to Malaysia. For our insurance customers, we launched the Banca EaSE app presenting an integrated dashboard which not only enables our agents to recommend products that are best-suited to our customers, but also allows customers to include non-Maybank data for a more comprehensive view of their portfolios.
Beyond banking, we are building ecosystems that simplify processes and improve 
efficiencies in key areas of our customers’ life journeys. For example, we broadened our home mortgage ecosystem by partnering with Sime Darby Property to offer a seamless home purchasing experience for home buyers by integrating Maybank Home
2u into Sime Darby Property’s Online Booking System (OBS). This allows home buyers to select their dream home and apply for a mortgage loan online, quickly and effortlessly. If they satisfy the standard criteria, their loan will be approved within seconds. The ability to connect with Sime Darby Property’s OBS is anchored on application programming interface (API) technology, which we are leveraging to develop more solutions that will serve customers’ needs better and faster. Further supporting our customer’s end-to-end (E2E) home ownership journey, we will be incorporating home renovation solutions, financing for renewable energy products such as solar panels and home insurance into our suite of offerings.
Meanwhile, to empower SMEs in Malaysia to balance their social responsibility, environmental 
and business growth goals, we have developed a one-stop integrated ecosystem for SMEs. This hub offers value-based solutions and serves as a knowledge repository to support SMEs in their transition journey towards sustainable practices. We also provide our SME customers with easy access to our online marketplace, Sama-Sama Lokal, to tap into a large network of suppliers and buyers. Additionally, we have simplified our SME customers’ payment processes, as they can now link their Maybank accounts to initiate bulk payments from third-party accounting systems. Another API-based achievement related to SMEs was the linking of Credit Guarantee Corporation Berhad’s platform with Maybank’s, enabling quicker access to cash for micro small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). Through this initiative, MSMEs can get their SME Digital Financing loans approved in under 10 minutes, from two days previously. Also, the money will be disbursed the same day the facility is accepted. We are especially proud of this financing innovation as it is the first-of-its-kind in Malaysia.
Internally, we have significantly enhanced our own productivity and customer service 
efficiency through the adoption of Agile principles. In June 2023, we rolled out our Agile Customer Experience (CX) @ Branch ensuring an optimally hassle-free experience for customers. Success with this project motivated us to apply the concept across 347 branches in Malaysia. Within 30 weeks, we have seen very encouraging improvements – with the average account opening time decreasing by 70% from 51 minutes to 15 minutes. Most importantly, our transactional Net Promoter Score has increased from +84% to +97%. We are now piloting the Agile CX @ Branch initiative at several branches in key cities across Indonesia. We have also launched the Agile CX @ Contact Centre to reduce the call waiting time for customers, improve the handling time and enhance the ability to reach Maybank Group Customer Care.
Leveraging Agile methodology, which emphasises cross-functional collaboration for 
continuous improvement, we are instilling Agile ways of working pervasively across our operations to further enhance efficiencies, improve productivity and optimise our resources. We are also automating our collections mechanism and using artificial intelligence to have human-like conversations with customers to improve collections. Outside of customer interactions, we are utilising machine learning and other best-in-class capabilities that can recognise complex patterns to detect financial crime and protect our customers.

pg. 110-150Shareholding Analysis and Other Information
pg. 151-160President and Group CEO’s Statement M25+ KEY HIGHLIGHTSIn addition to digital-based products and services, we are enhancing customer-centricity 
through targeted segmentation and concerted efforts to build end-to-end capabilities. In 2023, we established Group Islamic wealth management (IWM) hub in Singapore, making it our offshore go-to destination for any Shariah-compliant wealth management offerings. We also launched Indonesia’s first Shariah Wealth Management solutions for Maybank Indonesia’s privilege and premier customers.
Meanwhile, to support the overall growth of our mortgage business in Malaysia and to gain 
market share, we trained and assembled a dedicated workforce of close to 100 mortgage executives and enabled our Home
2u app to be accessed by our mortgage sales force to 
address both the primary and secondary property markets. Arising from this, the average origination and disbursement by our mortgage consultants rose, helping to boost our Malaysia mortgage portfolio growth to 10.4% YoY. We reorganised our SME business, bringing Retail SME, SME Plus and Business Banking businesses together under one roof, termed Commercial Banking. With this integrated business pillar, we are able to better organise our go-to-market approach and synergise our product offerings for all SME customers for an enhanced experience. The establishment of Commercial Banking is also a step towards our ambition of becoming the largest SME bank in Malaysia. We have already seen a 20% YoY increase in monthly loan origination to RM17.0 billion domestically. In Singapore and Indonesia, where we have increased our loan limits for SMEs as part of the re-segmentation exercise, our monthly loan origination has improved by more than double and 26.1% respectively.
In wholesale banking, we have emplaced a dedicated team to provide end-to-end services 
specially carved for the mid-market segment. This has seen good traction thus far, with our mid-market loans portfolio in Malaysia recording 11.2% YoY growth.
Despite undergoing this period of intense transformation, it is heartening to see that our 
employees remain highly engaged. Our Sustainable Engagement Index stands at 89% as we continue to perform above the Willis Towers Watson (WTW) Global High Performing Companies Norm. This achievement, along with our sixth recognition in the WTW High Performance Companies benchmark, underscores our commitment to both financial excellence and superior people practices.higher service charges and fees, commission and underwriting fees. Meanwhile, net fund based income stood lower at RM19.30 billion as net interest margin (NIM) compressed by 27 basis points to 2.12% due to higher funding cost and deposit competition as interest rates across our home markets started to return to pre-pandemic levels from 2022.
We managed to record strong loans growth of 9.2% YoY to RM640.75 billion in 2023, 
achieving a level of growth not seen since 2015. Our loans portfolios expanded across Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia by 6.7%, 8.7% and 6.2% respectively. Growth in Malaysia was led by the Commercial Banking segment at 9.0% YoY, consumer lending of 6.7% as the mortgage portfolio expanded 10.4% YoY, and corporate lending at 5.9% supported by growth in large and mid-market corporates at 18.5% and 11.2% respectively. Singapore’s growth mainly came from lending in the corporate segment of 16.0% and non-retail segment of 15.0%, offset by a 3.2% decline in the consumer portfolio. A portfolio rebalancing in Indonesia translated into stronger growth of 9.7% YoY from its Community Financial Services franchise with its non-retail portfolio growing for the first time since 2019 at 9.3%. This helped offset the marginal corporate lending portfolio growth of 0.8%, which was also a result of rebalancing away from the state-owned enterprise segment to the large corporate segment.
Supporting loans growth, total deposits grew 9.0% YoY driven by fixed deposits growth of 
11.2% led by Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia. Current and savings accounts (CASA) portfolio saw moderation in Singapore and Malaysia as consumer spending increased and customers moved towards higher yielding products. As a result, total CASA reduced 1.7% YoY with the Group CASA ratio landing at 36.9% in 2023 from 40.9% a year earlier. Our liquidity indicators such as liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio remained stable at 142.1% and 122.0% respectively.
Meanwhile, cost increased in FY2023 by 11.8% YoY to RM13.39 billion following the conclusion 
of the collective union agreements in Malaysia, which resulted in personnel costs increase due to inflationary-related adjustments, higher spend by the Group for IT expenses and right-of-use assets depreciation as well as an increase in revenue-related spend such as credit-card fees on higher merchant billings. Also, we spent RM304.7 million on our M25+ strategic programmes, of which 39% was for capital expenditure. Arising from the higher spend, the Group cost to income ratio stood at 48.9% versus 45.2% in FY2022.
Asset quality remained a key priority as we continue to manage our provisions prudently. Net 
impairment losses reduced 39.5% to RM1.68 billion, of which RM1.83 billion was set aside for loans while a net writeback of RM145.15 million was recognised for financial investments and others. Provisions for loans reduced by 16.3% YoY on some corporate borrower writebacks in 2023 and the absence of pre-emptive provisions made the previous year. Consequently, the Group’s net credit charge off rate improved to 31 bps against 40 bps in FY2022. The Group’s loan loss coverage ratio remained healthy at 124.9% from 131.2% a year ago while Group gross impaired loans ratio improved to 1.34% as at 31 December 2023 from 1.57% a year earlier.
Our profit before tax rose 5.6% to RM12.53 billion while net profit grew to a new record high 
of RM9.35 billion in FY2023, up 17.5% from RM7.96 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share increased 16.6% to 77.6 sen from 66.5 sen in FY2022. Meanwhile, return on equity was 10.8%, hitting the higher end of our FY2023 guidance of between 10.5% and 11.0%. At the same time, our post-dividend capital levels remained healthy with Group CET1 capital ratio and Group total capital ratio at 15.34% and 18.56% respectively as at 31 December 2023. Supported by our robust capital levels, we declared a total cash dividend of 60.0 sen per share for FY2023. This translated into an effective cash dividend payout of 77.4%, higher than our dividend payout policy of 40% to 60%.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE: NEW NET PROFIT HIGH
Our net operating income grew 3.3% to RM27.36 billion from RM26.49 billion in FY2022. This was led by strong growth in our non-interest income, up 38.3% YoY to RM8.06 billion, driven mainly by gains in investments and trading, foreign exchange on a stronger US dollar as well as higher core fees. The increase of 7.4% YoY in core fees was mainly attributed to

DIGITALISATION IN MALAYSIA AND THE REGION
We realise that building our digital capabilities and a culture of innovation is essential 
towards unlocking the full potential of our M25+ strategy in driving our next phase of growth. Following a deep dive into what it will take to develop a data-driven culture of continuous trial and evolution, three inter-related strategic pillars have been identified. 
The first is customer facing, with the objective of intensifying the E2E customer journey 
through the development of holistic ecosystems that go beyond banking, such as our home ownership and SME empowering platforms described above; and to scale up these ecosystems by taking them regional. This requires us to build front- and back-end infrastructure to support our customers’ journeys. It would also necessitate expanding our network of partnerships with online and offline partners to provide greater depth and scope of solutions to our customers.
The second pillar involves building our internal capabilities with the right digital infrastructure 
and the right digital skills and mindset among all Maybankers. Towards this end, we are accelerating our investments into increasingly advanced technologies, bringing on board the latest and most effective systems and automation. At the same time, we are enhancing data access across the Group by providing our people with the right digital tools to be able to access data quickly and efficiently to cater to our customers’ needs effectively. 
Finally, we seek to keep adding value for our retail and business customers through 
continuous innovation internally and in collaboration with strategic partners. The latter include suitable third-party businesses as well as start-ups which we can help to build and scale in order to create optimum synergies. Such an environment would support the continuous generation of new concepts which we can fine-tune in phases as we transform into an Agile organisation.As part of efforts to double down on our regionalisation strategy, we are rolling out digital solutions in our different home markets, adjusting these as far as possible to be optimally conducive to the local environment. The ultimate objective is to offer the same Maybank brand digital experience customised to local norms across ASEAN. Today our customers in Singapore, like their Malaysian counterparts, can use the M2U Lite app to open Maybank accounts online in a matter of seconds. In 2024, the same will be true for customers in Cambodia and the Philippines. Also as part of our regionalisation approach, we are enabling our account holders to open regional accounts, which would facilitate the transfer of funds across borders. The facility is currently available in Malaysia and Singapore. In addition to account opening, we are upgrading our Maybank Trade app to enable customers to invest in stocks across the region. The new-look, more user-friendly app iteration will be launched in 2024.
  For more details on our digital initiatives and innovation, please refer to the Pervasively Digital section 
on pages 64 to 66
SUSTAINABILITY LEADER ACROSS ASEAN
It has become evident in recent years that the global approach to climate change has to 
change drastically and fundamentally, with everyone contributing towards the low-to-no carbon transition. Financial institutions play a significant role in this endeavour through the strategic allocation of funds and Maybank is taking the lead in this regard regionally. We introduced the Maybank Group Sustainable Product Framework in 2022 to guide the development of products that would support sustainable projects broadly. In 2023, we launched the Transition Finance Framework focused specifically on the classification and recognition of transition financing solutions as well as the development of products that would promote the greening of industries. Both frameworks have been firsts in the region. Recognising that clients in energy-intense sectors will need additional support, we are close to completing our science-based net zero pathway and strategy for sectors including power and palm oil.
Underlining our commitment to low-carbon economies, Maybank has been actively 
engaging and partnering with regulators, policy makers, other financial institutions and customers towards developing credible, orderly and just transition plans. During the year, we partnered with the Institute of International Finance (IIF) to host the inaugural IIF – Maybank Transition Finance Workshop for our clients and IIF members. The event featured conversations with regulators and policy makers; panel discussions on achieving climate transition in Asia; as well as interactive case studies with leading firms across the region.
Our coordinated action on climate issues has resulted in Maybank’s Carbon Disclosure 
Project (CDP) score improving to B in 2023 from C previously, placing us among 43% of companies in the financial services sector but above 35% of our peers. We are the only Malaysian bank to receive such a rating and are ahead of the performance of companies in Asia and globally that averaged C. CDP is a non-profit organisation that runs the global disclosure system on environmental reporting by companies and cities.
Of our four sustainability commitments, commitment 3 – achieving carbon neutrality by 
2030 and a net zero position by 2050 – sets the tone of our decarbonisation agenda. In addition to guiding our clients’ transition journeys, we continue to embrace the most energy-efficient solutions within the Group and have begun to supplement this with carbon offsets towards reaching net zero. In 2023, Maybank secured 5,000 carbon credits from the newly-established Bursa Carbon Exchange market, which will lower our emissions by 3.3% from the 2019 baseline.

pg. 110-150Shareholding Analysis and Other Information
pg. 151-160President and Group CEO’s Statement While focusing intently on decarbonisation, we have not neglected our other sustainability 
commitments. In fact, we exceeded our annual targets for each of the other three commitments that are to be achieved by 2025, namely: mobilising RM80 billion in sustainable finance; improving the lives of two million households across ASEAN; and achieving one million hours per annum on sustainability and delivering one thousand significant United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)-related outcomes.
Within Maybank itself, we have been placing greater emphasis on developing holistic 
policies to protect the well-being of our employees. Other than to introduce the Maybank Group Dignity Policy, as mentioned by our Chairman, we have developed the Group Human Rights Policy to ensure we uphold our responsibility as a corporation to respect human rights across the Group and our value chain, aligned to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights 2011.
It is indeed encouraging to see our efforts translate into recognition which include becoming 
the first Malaysian bank to receive Global Finance’s Outstanding Leadership in Sustainability Transparency – Asia Pacific award as well as its Best Bank for Sustainable Finance – Malaysia award.
  For more details on our sustainability initiatives and achievements, refer to the Sustainability 
Statement section on pages 101 to 109FUTURISATION OF THE WORKPLACE FOR OUR NEXT-GEN WORKFORCE
In addition to respecting the rights of our employees, we have continuously invested in 
helping them to realise their potential. Today, as we seek to become an Agile next-gen organisation, we are intensifying efforts to revolutionise the way we work, and especially to create a mindset in which everyone feels empowered to contribute ideas, and even to risk failure. During the year, we invited tech giants such as Google, Meta, TikTok, Wiz AI and Microsoft to share their experiences, especially in relation to new digital concepts. Agile workshops, ideathons and hackathons are organised to mine ideas, especially on how to continuously enhance the customer experience. Employees are encouraged to use the data available to them to make quick decisions; and to have short but frequent interactions with colleagues – via daily stand-ups for example – to share, update and provide or obtain feedback where necessary. All of these initiatives promote a more energised environment in which things are done faster and more efficiently.
Having seen how ideation has worked to improve the customer journey, this year we 
leveraged the same principle to encourage employees to think more deeply about sustainability, and to generate more sustainability solutions. A Maybank Sustainability Ideathon was held which saw 46 teams submit proposals to address some of our sustainability challenges. Of these, 12 teams were chosen to attend an intensive three-day workshop during which they were guided to expand their ideas using design thinking, and provided training on presentation skills. Subsequently, the teams pitched their ideas to a panel of judges during our Maybank Group Sustainability Week and the grand prize-winning team won RM10,000 to kick-start their project on food waste management.
We continued to empower Maybankers to become a bionic workforce by unlocking their 
potential through upskilling and equipping them with the appropriate technology and capabilities. For instance, we undertook a large scale desktop and laptop replacement exercise with system upgrades in 2023 that impacted close to 10,000 staff in Malaysia. This was done to help improve the productivity and efficiency of our staff, especially benefiting those at our branches.
We also seek to stimulate greater employee engagement, collaboration and rejuvenation as 
we believe it would promote the generation of more ideas and innovation. Accordingly, we designed a mini-retreat, T-POD (with stands for TIGER POD or Tech POD), in Menara Maybank. The space encompasses a Hangout Zone, Tranquillity Zone, Gamer Zone and Theatre Zone, where Maybankers can go and chill, alone or with others. Since its launch on 25 October, T-POD has attracted significant footfall, lending reason to believe it could become a hotbed for creativity.
It is also my pleasure to share that M-Youth, the platform we created in 2022 to empower 
youth across the Group, is making waves through its series of leadership programmes as well as hangouts, game nights, brown bag sessions and conversations centred around the latest trends and topics. In 2023, we set up the M-Youth Council to focus on youth engagement. The Council organised our first month-long GenM Global Summit, which involved over 17,000 employees in over 100 activities, generating more than 400 growth ideas. Ultimately, we would like to provide a workspace and culture that empower  
and inspire our next–gen employees, which currently make up 21% of our workforce in 2023.  
We seek to grow our digital technology and analytics populations from 9% in 2023 to 27% by 2027.

from the quality of products and services, to our people management, sustainability initiatives and governance. Each award is meaningful and motivates us to keep doing better. This year, however, two awards stand out for reflecting the enormous advances we have made as a values-based bank that places the customer above all else.
We were the only Malaysian corporation to feature among 750 companies in TIME 
magazine’s World’s Best Companies 2023, with a sustainability ranking of 374. The criteria used in selecting the winning companies included revenue growth, employee satisfaction and ESG performance. Maybank was also named Bank of the Year in Asia Pacific and in Singapore for the first time by The Banker. The Banker cited the revamp of our banking systems, expertise and data-based services as well as improved customer experience as key attributes that led to our wins.forward-looking blueprint, there is still much to be done to achieve our goals. To maintain our leading edge in terms of customer-centricity, digitalisation and sustainability, moreover, we will have to invest continuously in our people, processes and programmes. This will help to drive greater innovation across all our operations as we complete our transformation into a truly Agile organisation.
Our data insights indicate that there are untapped opportunities to enhance up-selling and 
cross-selling opportunities as well as improve digital engagements across our retail and non-retail segments. Thus, we will intensify our efforts to deepen our relationships with existing and new customers, while leveraging our ecosystem play endeavours and rolling out digital solutions to meet E2E customer lifestyle and business needs. In anticipation of improved ASEAN economic growth, Maybank is poised to capitalise on identified growth in key areas such as wealth management, cash management and bancassurance while broadening our market penetration in the non-retail segments, especially among SMEs and mid-market companies. For FY2024, we have set a headline key performance indicator for return on equity of 11%.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
In concluding my statement, I would like to note my deep appreciation for the Maybank team, from our Board of Directors to my colleagues in EXCO and all employees across the Group. Thank you for your dedication to Maybank and your individual contributions that, collectively, have seen us evolve to become a leading regional bank.
On behalf of the leadership, I would also like to express our gratitude to two of our senior 
leaders who retired in 2023 – former Country CEO and CEO of Maybank Singapore Dr. John Lee Hin Hock who served the Group for 13 years and our previous Group Chief Risk Officer Gilbert Kohnke who served close to six years. Their positions have been assumed respectively by Alvin Lee Han Eng effective 1 January 2024, formerly our Head, Community Financial Services, Singapore; and Datuk Hamzah Bachee effective 1 July 2023, formerly our Deputy Group Chief Risk Officer.
Meanwhile, effective 1 March 2024, new EXCO appointments were made to drive business 
growth and ensure long-term sustainability in line with M25+ with Dato’ Muzaffar Hisham taking the role of Group CEO of Islamic Banking and an additional Group role to spearhead our advancement of value-based banking, from his previous role as Group CEO, Global Banking. Dato’ John Chong Eng Chuan, previously Group CEO, Community Financial Services (CFS), takes on the role of Group CEO of Global Banking, while newly appointed Syed Ahmad Taufik Albar succeeds Dato’ John as the new Group CEO of CFS. Our gratitude to Dato’ Mohamed Rafique Merican Mohd Wahiduddin Merican who will retire at the end of June 2024.
It would be remiss to not acknowledge all our external stakeholders, who have also been 
instrumental in the Group’s ongoing journey. On behalf of Maybank, I would like to thank the governments and regulators in our home markets, our customers, shareholders, business partners and communities for your varied yet equally valuable contributions. We look forward to strengthening our relationships as we progress into the next phase of Maybank’s continuing evolution.A POSITIVE OUTLOOK FOR 2024
Global GDP growth is likely to moderate to 2.8% in 2024 (2023: 3.3%) on softer outlook for major economies such as the US and China. However, ASEAN growth is set to be firmer at 4.5% from 4.0% in 2023, supported by resilient domestic demand and sustained tourism as well as recovery in some parts of the manufacturing sector and exports.
Across our home markets, Malaysia’s economy is anticipated to grow faster at 4.4% in 2024 
from 3.7% in 2023 driven by a rebound in exports amid sustained consumer spending and investment growth. Meanwhile, Singapore’s GDP growth is expected at 2.2% in 2024 (2023: 1.1%) as the manufacturing sector recovers while spending in the services sector normalises. Indonesia’s GDP growth is projected to remain stable at 5.1% versus 5.0% in 2023 from steady household expenditure, a resilient labour market and policy support.
Amid the complexities of our divergent markets, Maybank will continue to keep our strategy 
simple and straightforward by continuing to be guided by M25+. Key market dynamics that we are experiencing today are not substantially different from those that inspired our current strategic blueprint, hence it remains relevant to our ultimate purpose of becoming a values-driven platform, powered by a bionic workforce that Humanises Financial Services. While we have made very encouraging progress in the first full year of this

DELIVERING A POSITIVE IMPACT THROUGH 
VALUE CREATION
Our ability to create value for our five 
stakeholder groups is anchored on business activities overlaid with strong risk management and governance, which are reported in detail in this IAR. We have also specified key indicators used to determine the value creation for our stakeholders at the business and Group levels. 
  Refer to How We Engage and Create Value 
for Our Stakeholders and Key Performance Indicators on pages 28 to 32 and 62 to 63Our IAR serves as an avenue to describe how Maybank creates value over time by considering the operating environment for markets in which we are present as well as the needs, 
interests and material matters of our various stakeholder groups. We also consider ways to mitigate and manage our risks to help enhance opportunities impacting our customers, business segments and the Group. Our strategy and capital allocations, which adhere to the risk and governance frameworks integrated in our business model, drive the performance of the business segments and Group in creating sustainable value over the short, medium and long term.
FORMULATE BUSINESS STRATEGY
Taking into consideration our operating context, risks and opportunities and what our stakeholders want as well as their 
material considerations, we shape our strategic thrusts for long-term value creation which is measured by key performance indicators under our M25+ strategy. The five strategic thrusts will be enabled by 12 strategic programmes (SPs) to strengthen our foundation and competitiveness by creating the greatest value, customer experience uplift, cross-sector collaboration and regional integration Group-wide through technology. Anchoring the Group’s strategy is our mission of Humanising Financial Services, embodied through our purpose statement.

Our Purpose Statement:
We are a values-driven platform,  powered by a bionic workforce that Humanises Financial Services
RESOURCE ALLOCATION THAT IS INTEGRATED INTO OUR BUSINESS MODEL
In deciding how to manage and grow our business, we consider our resources and relationships that facilitate our value 
creation and preservation process, and minimise value erosion. Our resources are captured as six capitals in the business model, which are deployed through our business activities to generate outputs that ultimately lead to capital outcomes that benefit specific stakeholders. Most outcomes will create value while some will see preservation or erosion. In making strategic decisions, there will also be trade-offs between creating short-term and long-term value.

Allocating resources to propel digital innovationThe transformation of our technology capabilities is paramount to enhance customer-centricity through digital solutions, ensuring agility and mitigating the risk of losing relevance. Creating an innovative environment requires strategic capital investments in technologies and talents, fostering innovation and fortifying cyber resilience. These initiatives will directly influence our financial, manufacturing and intellectual capitals.
Managing productivity and relationships strategicallyAlthough digitalisation enhances our productivity, it also leads to a reduction of face-to-face engagement with our customers. Our commitment is to uphold our humanising approach by integrating our digital and physical touchpoints, ensuring the consistent delivery of seamless and personalised services across multiple channels.
Transitioning towards next-gen workforceAs traditional and administrative roles are progressively being replaced by next-gen capabilities, it is increasingly more critical for us to invest in a digitally-savvy, customer-centric and sustainability-conscious workforce. Equipping Maybankers with the right tools and capabilities while fostering collaboration will yield improved productivity and financial returns over the longer term.
Be the force for goodAligned with our mission of Humanising Financial Services, we strive to create meaningful change in the communities we serve by advancing financial inclusion, education and skills development. Providing financial services to underserved segments aligns with our overarching goal of promoting financial inclusion. 
Shifting gears to combat climate changeIn our commitment to combat climate change, Maybank recognises the need for a just transition, addressing risks and opportunities in high ESG-risk businesses. Short-term trade-offs may emerge between lost business opportunities and adhering to our ESG risk management principles. However, in the long run, we will be contributing to the enhancement of our natural, financial, human and social capitals.

the Group’s sustainability mission, goals, targets, governance and approach in all our activities, the robust framework enables us to embed sustainability into all our activities, products and services as we strive to serve our communities without harming people or the environment.

pg. 72-109Leadership and Governance in Creating and Preserving Value
pg. 110-150Shareholding Analysis and Other Information
pg. 151-160Approach to Sustainability Materiality Assessment MatrixOur sustainability material matters are determined via in-
depth materiality assessments that are conducted every two years. Inputs from our stakeholders are further used to review our sustainability strategy from time to time in order to reflect evolving issues and interests. This process allows us to focus on impact-based solutions for our customers while empowering our communities as we embed sustainability across our core business. 
Following the last materiality assessment conducted in 
FY2022, in FY2023 we reviewed the material issues identified to ensure their continued relevance to our business and its impacts, as well as alignment with stakeholder interests and concerns. 
KEY OBSERVATIONS
During the materiality validation process, we conducted a desktop review to compare our material matters and risks against those of local, regional and global industry peers. While the analysis revealed a general alignment with industry, there were two areas in which Maybank’s commitment to sustainability stood out. These were in our distinct prioritisation of “Public policy and advocacy” and “Board and executive compensation, independence and diversity”. As a key financier in ASEAN, we recognise and emphasise the importance of addressing these crucial matters to uphold our sustainability values. Our material matters were cross-referenced against Bursa Malaysia’s 11 common sustainability matters, GRI topic standards, and SASB industry-specific indicators. We also ensured our material issues align with the 17 UN SDGs. 
Further enhancing the thoroughness of our material matters review, we sent out a smaller and targeted survey to 48 
respondents, requiring them to rate which of the material topics Maybank should address and how well Maybank is managing or addressing these material topics as well as what should Maybank prioritise. The respondents consisted of customers from our key business segments, covering Group CFS, Group GB and Group Insurance and Takaful. They ranked “Privacy, data security and responsible use of technology”, “Ethical, transparent and accountable business”, and “Enhancing the customer experience” as Maybank’s top three material matters; and ”Board and executive compensation, independence and diversity”, “Public policy and advocacy” and “Investing in our community” as the lowest.

pg. 151-160Sustainability Material Matters  Amid a surprisingly resilient US economy and end of China’s zero COVID-19 policy, ASEAN-6 economies grew moderately at 4.0% in 2023, in part due to the base effect following full 
economic re-opening that drove 2022 real GDP growth to 5.7%. Monetary policy tightening in the wake of cumulative interest rate hikes by central banks and a cyclical downturn in the global electronics industry added to the moderation.
Global GDP growth is expected at 2.8% in 2024 (2023: 3.3%) reflecting a softer outlook for major economies such as the US (2024: 1.0%; 2023: 2.5%) and China (2024: 4.4%; 2023: 5.2%). 
Meanwhile, ASEAN growth is expected to be firmer (2024: 4.5%; 2023: 4.0%), supported by domestic demand and tourism, as well as recovery in technology-related manufacturing and exports given the turnround in global electronics demand since late 2023.

2024 Outlook
• Firmer domestic growth on rebound in export of goods 
and services amid sustained consumer spending and investment growth.
•
 BNM to keep OPR at 3.00% given upside risk to inflation (2024: 3.0%; 2023: 2.5%) from fuel subsidy rationalisation and services tax rate hike.
•
 With expected US rate cuts, ringgit to improve vs US dollar to 4.40 (end 2023: 4.59). MADANI Economy and other national programmes will further strengthen the ringgit and capital market sentiment.2024 Outlook
•
 Growth to be stronger and more balanced as 
manufacturing recovers while revenge spending in services fades. Brighter growth outlook is anticipated in exports, manufacturing and trade-related services sectors.
•
 Core and headline inflation are expected to average at 2.8% and 3% in 2024, respectively, from 4.2% and 4.8% in 2023. Core inflation will remain above historical levels, due to the GST hikes, carbon taxes and wage cost pressures. Headline inflation will, however, be capped by lower private transport prices while accommodation 
inflation should ease.
•
 MAS is expected to reduce the pace of appreciation of the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) in late 2024.2024 Outlook
•
 Household expenditure should remain steady and 
supported by a modest election boost, policy support 
and a resilient labour market. There could be lingering investment uncertainty as firms wait for more clarity on post-election policies, even as the single-round election reduces political overhang. Capital expenditure will be cushioned by a ramp-up in public infrastructure spending. Exports will remain subdued on easing commodity prices.
•
 Inflation should ease to 3%. Food prices should remain 
elevated in first half 2024 as El Nino delays harvests.
• BI is expected to cut rates as easing Fed rates provide leeway to relax policy.

* Based on refreshed MAS disclosure of resident and non-resident lending, excluding interbank
2023 Review
• Industry loan growth moderated to 5.3% from 5.7% in 2022 amid slower economic expansion. Household loan growth held steady at 5.8% (2022: 5.9%), while non-household loans grew at a slightly slower pace of 4.5% (2022: 5.3%).
•
 Net interest margins (NIMs) continued to face pressure from intense deposit competition which lessened somewhat with the 25bps OPR hike in May 2023.
•
 Robust non-interest income, mainly from investment and/or foreign exchange gains, supported operating income.
•
 Operating expenses picked up after reduced spending in recent years, coupled with increased unionised personnel costs and IT/technology spend.
•
 Absolute impaired loans were stable YoY, rising 0.8% at 
end-2023. The industry’s gross impaired loans (GIL) ratio improved to 1.65% from 1.72% end-2022. As such, credit 
costs were generally lower on a YoY basis.
•
 Net earnings expanded in the absence of Cukai Makmur with dividend payouts for most returning to pre-COVID levels.2023 Review
•
 Supported by Fed rate hikes, banks were able to price up their assets faster than cost of funding, resulting in robust NIMs, which expanded 46bps YoY.
•
 Higher funding costs saw loan demand fall 2.9% YoY, especially business loan demand (-3.9% YoY). The 
semiconductor sector slowdown, price sensitivity and macro uncertainty were felt keenly by the manufacturing and SME sectors, while corporates repaid credit lines to lower funding costs.
•
 Consumer loans were resilient led by mortgages supported by buoyant property sector and credit cards as travel took off.
•
 Strong liquidity flow into the system – led by high rates and Singapore’s safe haven status – drove 4.3% YoY increase in deposits. This kept deposit competition benign despite entry of digital challengers.
•
 Fee income growth saw headwinds with wealth 
management fees stagnating as clients chose to enjoy higher deposit rates versus riskier products.
•
 Operating costs remained stable with sector cost to income falling 2.7% YoY.
•
 System NPLs reduced to 1.7% (2022: 1.8%). Loan moratorium roll-offs were uneventful, while strong fiscal stimulus, low unemployment and accelerated loan re-payments contributed to benign asset quality.
•
 The pace of general provision write-backs slowed in second half 2023 while specific provisions picked up slightly as the sector looked cautiously at the macro environment.2023 Review
•
 Loans growth remained robust at 10.3% YoY in 2023 supported by demand in corporate lending. Credit demand remained strong in all segments, i.e.: investment, working capital and consumer lending, with business recovery.
•
 Gross NPL ratio improved to 2.19% by December 2023 (end 2022: 2.44%) while loans at risk stood at 10.94% (end 2022: 14.05%), showing recovery from previously restructured 
loans.
•
 Loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) rose to 83.8% in December 
2023 (end 2022: 78.8%) from weaker deposit growth of 3.7% YoY (2022: 9.0% YoY).
•
 NIM expanded slightly to 4.81% in 2023 (FY2022: 4.71%) as loans growth offset cost of funding.
•
 Capital adequacy ratio of 27.65% at December 2023 was 
well above the minimum regulatory requirement of 8%.Malaysia Singapore Indonesia
System Loan: 2024 (f): 5.1% | 2023: 5.3% | 2022: 5.7% System Loan: 2024 (f): 3.1% | 2023*: -2.9% | 2022: 2.1% System Loan: 2024 (f): 9.5% | 2023: 10.3% | 2022: 11.4%
2024 Outlook
• Loans growth is expected to remain stable amid a 
pick-up in domestic economic growth.
• NIMs are expected to stabilise, while the OPR should remain unchanged.
•
 Capital ratios remain comfortable, with the industry CET1 ratio averaging 14.9% at end 2023. Dividend payouts are expected to remain stable.
•
 Five digital banks are expected to commence operations by April 2024, but are unlikely to pose much of a 
competition to incumbents anytime soon.2024 Outlook
•
 NIMs are expected to moderate due to potential 
interest rate cuts by the Fed.
• Loan demand is expected to rise as funding costs decrease, especially for trade finance, manufacturing and SMEs. Consumer loans, especially mortgages, could increase with more units coming online.
•
 Wealth management AUM parked under deposits may 
shift to higher fee generating products to offset falling rates. This could drive an inflection in fee income.
•
 Asset quality faces potential downside risk and limited write-back of provisions is expected given uncertainties including slowdown in China and geo-political events.
•
 Competition from digital challengers could intensify with product innovations and cross-selling strategies.2024 Outlook
•
 Loans growth is expected at 9.5% from higher demand 
for working capital and consumption, while deposits slow down to 5%, tightening liquidity with LDR expected to increase to 88%.
•
 There should be minimal impact from end of loan restructuring, since most banks have been prudent in provisioning and writing off loans.
•
 Cost of funds should stay elevated in first half 2024 as funding competition increases and BI maintains higher reference rates and reserve requirement ratio. However, if BI cuts its rate in second half 2024, there could be margin improvement as cost of funds would likely drop.

INSURANCE RISKTIR
Risk Description and Value 
Creation Implications:
The value proposition of 
insurance and takaful operators can be profoundly influenced by adverse changes in the value of underwritten takaful/insurance liabilities due to adverse deviation in portfolio experience as well as underlying assumptions/expectations on which product, pricing, underwriting, claims, reserving and reinsurance/retakaful have been made.Key Mitigation Actions:
• Prepared for implementation of regulatory-driven projects such as phased liberalisation of motor and fire tariffs, and climate risk management and scenario analysis. 
•
 Active calibration and monitoring of key risks and early warning indicators.
•
 Performed risk assessment for new products and new reinsurer/retakaful operators on reinsurance/retakaful arrangement.
•
 Established flood modelling capabilities with continuous enhancement on data granularity to improve flood risk preparedness to address potential climate change impact.Associated Opportunities:•
 Competitive pricing with effective risk management should support sustainable profitability and attract more customers and contribute to their retention.
•
 Awareness of associated risks would guide product innovation and market expansion.Outcome in 2023:We deployed effective management of takaful and insurance risks to preserve and enhance our values which includes robust underwriting practices, prudent risk management, adequate reserves, diversified investment strategies, strong regulatory compliance, among others.Risk Movement:
While the risk trend in takaful and insurance remains stable, the Group remains steadfast in monitoring any potential shifts in risk movement. Vigilance in assessing underwriting management, regulatory compliance, market conditions, and emerging risks emphasises our commitment to proactive risk management. This approach ensures our readiness to address any future changes in the risk environment while upholding our reputation for prudent risk mitigation practices.

pg. 151-160Our Strategy  M25+ : FROM GOOD TO GREAT
2023 was a year of building the foundations of our M25+ strategy. Staying true to the five key strategic thrusts (STs), Maybank doubled down on customer-centricity, tailoring our offerings 
to customers’ unique needs through hyper-personalisation while developing solutions beyond traditional banking. Throughout the first year of M25+ implementation, about RM304.72 million was invested into the 12 strategic programmes (SPs) resulting in 231 Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) deployed. 
Through Agile ways of working, multiple product solutions and platforms were launched in the consumer, wholesale, Islamic, SME and insurance segments across the region. We also 
improved our customer experience through enhanced touchpoint operations and value-driven digital capabilities via personalised offerings, making it easier for customers to interact and transact with Maybank. 
Ensuring the success of M25+, we are investing in our employees as we nurture a bionic workforce. Maybankers are empowered to deliver better customer service via improved processes 
and automated systems/tools that enable them to offer personalised financing solutions and effective advice on the products that best suit our customers’ needs. Ultimately, this drives faster internal turnaround times (TAT) and accelerated time to market.

In realising M25+ and the 12 SPs outlined, we will be allocating not only financial resources 
– capital and funding – but also our organisational capabilities and expertise for optimum outcomes. The volume or quantity channelled to each SP will be based on various factors, including the criticality of specific initiatives in achieving the related STs and the expected revenue uplift or longer-term value created for the sustainability and continued relevance of the organisation.

pg. 151-160Key Performance Indicators OVERVIEW
We revolutionise the customer journey by going beyond conventional banking and developing hyper-personalised digital solutions 
within a cohesive digital ecosystem that supports the entire customer lifecycle. Anchored by our commitment to customer-centricity, acceleration of digitalisation and technology modernisation, as well as regional expansion, our digital strategy is premised on three pivotal pillars:
We also prioritise the “regional first” approach to scale swiftly across ASEAN, leveraging advanced technological platforms and 
emerging tech applications.Pervasively DigitalScan here to view “Digitising banking,  
humanising financial services” video
KEY FOCUS AREAS FOR 2023
Intensify end-to-end customer journey through 
ecosystem play at scale regionally
As we digitalise and expand our solutions to enhance 
banking journeys, we envision ourselves as a life advisor that supports our retail and business customers’ journey across their life stages. Moving away from a product oriented approach, we have adopted Agile methodology in user research to gather a 360° view of our customers’ preferences. We aspire to understand our customers comprehensively through the integration of internal and external data, employing advanced analytics via our in-house big data and analytics platform, M-INSIGHT, to develop data-driven personalisation. The automated self-service data platform facilitates real-time analytics across the region, empowering data-driven decisions and proactive customer support. To date, we have onboarded the data from more than 12 million active retail customers onto Maybank’s feature store, translating to more than 2,000 features that our business units can utilise to tailor product offerings to our customers. By reducing the time taken for insight gathering and streamlining processes by 80%, we achieve agility in time to market and the ability to personalise customer engagements across our business segments. For example, Etiqa elevated its customer digital experience by introducing a one-click renewal feature that allows customers to renew their motor policy digitally and also enabling automatic payment for flight delay claims for flight delays of more than two hours. The new personalised motor policy solution has gained traction with over RM30 million premiums generated on the Etiqa application as at 31 December 2023.Intensify end-to-end customer journey 
through ecosystem play at scale regionally 
Embrace true digitalisation among Maybankers Create new value through innovation and partnerships 
Meanwhile, we continue to accelerate our ecosystem strategy to drive customer stickiness and scale our business across ASEAN. 
We have expanded the integration of our application programming interface (API) between our M-CONNECT platform and various supporting ecosystems that provide our customers access to Maybank’s solutions and our partners’ non-banking solutions related to home purchases, SME and travel insurance needs. Among our more notable initiatives has been the partnership between Maybank Home
2u and a consortium of property developers in Malaysia to broaden our home ownership ecosystem. 
Through this API-powered platform, home buyers can view more than 2,900 property listings and enjoy a seamless loan application process with instant loan approvals. Our API approach has also enabled us to roll out new products regionally in less than six months, roughly three times faster than the 12 to 18 months it would take previously. This was evidenced in the development of MAE in Cambodia and the Philippines through the unified regional services embedded in M-CONNECT.

We also use API to enhance the customer experience in the non-retail segments. Among others, our transaction banking business has introduced reporting and payment APIs to enhance the digital trade experience of our corporate clients. At the same time, we are collaborating with Credit Guarantee Corporation Berhad (CGC) to provide real-time loan approvals for SMEs with instant access to cash upon the acceptance of the loan facility. We have also broadened our suite of digital offerings for SMEs to include merchant services and accounting software integration to ease their day-to-day business activities and operations. Besides focusing on offering a complete suite of products and services to cater for our customers' life journeys, we are also stepping up our regionalisation efforts. Today, SME customers in Malaysia, Singapore and Cambodia can access SME Digital 
Financing.
Meanwhile, SMEs in Cambodia can apply for loans digitally and accept payments seamlessly for their business 
via dynamic and static KHQR from its digital touchpoint and physical shop. In Indonesia, we also offer auto-debit payments for business-to-business (B2B) transactions via M2E, helping to ease our non-retail customers’ payment processes and enabling faster transactions between businesses and their suppliers.
As part of our M25+ strategic vision to strengthen our regional presence, we have increased our digital cross-
border services and financial solutions to cater to the evolving needs of our customers. For instance, Maybank Malaysia cardholders can enjoy no-charge withdrawals at Maybank ATMs overseas; cross-border DuitNow QR

View feature within our mobile application and web that allow Maybank customers in Malaysia and Singapore to view all their Maybank accounts, fixed and term deposits, cards, loans and wealth products to enable seamless management of their finances via a single dashboard. Meanwhile, our non-retail and corporate customers can now digitally self-onboard on our Maybank2E (M2E) Cash platform while we rolled out a refreshed regional M2E app called M2E Global, which allows all M2E Regional Cash Management customers to manage their working capital and transactions securely via the Secure2u digital token, eliminating the need for a physical security device.
Embrace true digitalisation among Maybankers
Digitalisation was also accelerated via multi-disciplinary Agile initiatives across business functions in Maybank. We empowered our customer-facing Maybankers with advanced solutions such as the internal sales force application, business intelligence and life advisory tools to increase their productivity and enable personalised interactions with customers. Our new sales force application now integrates various related applications, tools and processes such as Maybank Home
2u, Wealth 360 and straight-through 
processing (STP) for hire purchase into one common platform for our sales personnel. As such, our mortgage consultants, relationship managers and personal financial advisors now have full and complete insights into customers’ portfolios and are able to process loan applications more efficiently. Since its launch, we have onboarded approximately 98% of our mortgage sales personnel onto the platform. Similarly, our insurance arm introduced an integrated dashboard, Banca EaSE, for its agents to extract financial data with customers’ consent and recommend products that are best-suited to them. The platform also allows customers to include non-Maybank data to enable a more comprehensive view of their portfolio.
As for back-end operations, we continue to employ artificial 
intelligence (AI) and machine learning tools to improve our productivity. Among others, we are building digital capabilities to enhance our fraud and compliance processes for auto detection of financial crimes. Additionally, we are automating our collections through conversational AI to reduce the need for dedicated resources for collection purposes.
These capabilities are supported by advanced in-house 
next-gen technology platforms. This year, we have developed three new platforms, namely M-ARCH, M-DEVx, and M-WORKx, expanding our suite of platforms which include M-CONNECT and M-INSIGHT, to revolutionise the way we work across the Group. The hybrid multi-cloud infrastructure and automation platform M-ARCH automates routine processes and operations, while the collaborative tech platform M-DEVx allows our developers to build apps faster, reduce test times through automation, and provide real-time feedback for corrective action. These platforms have enabled us to roll out technology infrastructure services 20 times faster than before, and to double our productivity in developing new capabilities. Meanwhile, M-WORKx is a robust collaboration platform that empowers a bionic workforce by providing seamless access to knowledge and tools.
Create new value through innovation and partnerships
To foster a culture of innovation and collaboration, we have 
introduced transformative platforms through our Customer Experience and Innovation Lab, including the Incubation Hotbed, Centre of Excellence and Co-creation Accelerator. These platforms allow Maybankers to build end-to-end prototypes and orchestrate user experience activities as well as provide comprehensive support in solving business problems. Additionally, we are actively nurturing a community of changemakers among Maybankers. Initiatives such as I(deas) of the Tiger Hackathons and the Maybank Elevator Pitch Challenge serve as catalysts for innovation at scale. Complementing these initiatives, we have curated digital-related workshops to equip Maybankers with knowledge on data, generative AI, idea refinement and design thinking. This strategic approach ensures that Maybankers are well-versed in various technologies, fostering a workforce that is proficient at navigating the evolving landscape of digital innovation.
Strategic partnerships and collaborations are also paramount 
in our pursuit to scale innovation. Partnerships with start-ups and synergistic businesses are integral to exploring new business models, embracing the early adoption of emerging technologies and capabilities, gaining access to new markets and customers, as well as expanding our network to secure scarce talent.
Fortifying against cybercrime in the digital banking 
space 
The increased prevalence and sophistication of cybercrime 
is a constant threat to the digital banking space. While we strive to offer cutting-edge digital solutions to make banking accessible and convenient for our customers, we have also been diligent in ensuring the safety of our customers’ assets. Our commitment to delivering exceptional service is exemplified by the implementation of the zero defect initiative. We aspire to achieve 99.99% system uptime to ensure the reliability and security of our digital banking services.In Malaysia, we remain supportive of Bank Negara Malaysia 
(BNM)’s five key measures to combat scam. In January 2023, we launched the Kill Switch feature via Maybank2u (M2U) web and MAE app by allowing customers to immediately deactivate their M2U access with just a simple click of a button should they notice something peculiar or believe they have been scammed. Starting from June 2023, Secure2u is the default transaction authentication for all transactions on M2U and MAE app. From October 2023 onwards, all first-time Secure2u activations and activations on new devices will require physical activation via Maybank ATMs. 
Towards enhanced awareness, we continue to educate the 
public on scams and frauds via press releases and campaigns on our websites, social media platforms as well as radio and newspapers. In addition, we utilise the LCD screens at our branches and ATM/SST screens to display scam warnings. We have also joined forces with other financial institutions in Malaysia to launch scam awareness campaigns to help the public combat financial scams and fraudulent banking activities.

Strategic programme 10 (SP10) was set up to elevate Maybankers to achieve our M25+ 
strategy. Among others, the emphasis was on:
• Acceleration of Maybankers into next-gen roles underpinned by future skills that will 
power our digital, customer-centric and sustainability focused business model and infrastructure.
•
 Securing top talent and future skills needed through a well-demonstrated employer value proposition (EVP).
•
 Enhancing Maybankers’ skills, capabilities and competence to augment their performance with the technologies available at their disposal, while entrenching a modus operandi driven by a mind-set prioritising solutions and speed.
Through an in-depth skills assessment of expertise required across the Maybank Group today and for a sustainable future, a skills-based framework of 501 unique skills has been established, encompassing 294 tech and 221 emerging next-gen skills.
Additionally, we have transformed our performance management with the OKR framework, 
an Agile approach that deviates from traditional KPI-setting to encourage collaborative goal-setting between employees and managers. We have onboarded 400 employees onto the OKR performance management platform through 36 workshops, clinics and OKR refreshers. Furthermore, our intensified organisational development initiatives have resulted in approximately 1,000 employees being reskilled, remapped and/or redeployed to next-gen 
roles alongside a recalibration of organisation structures.
To further facilitate the adoption of Agile methodologies, we have recruited Agile coaches 
and certified 783 employees in Agile fundamentals, alongside engaging 761 participants in more than 28 Agile facilitation and coaching sessions.
These efforts have resulted in the following key impacts for the Group’s leaders and 
workforce:
Enhanced Employee Development with Measurable Impact – Targeted skillset 
evaluations lead to tailored learning journeys, boosting employee engagement and retention, ensuring Maybank can continue to secure critical talent.Strategic Workforce Planning – Leaders gain a data-driven perspective for effective workforce management and future skills projections. We have assessed over 43,000 roles to determine our workforce readiness for next-gen or transitional capabilities.
Track Organisational Skills Growth  – By providing an overview of the skills 
required in the Bank based on job clusters, line managers have reference points regarding the transition to next-gen roles.
Empowering Employee Talent Mobility – Our workforce planning tools and skills matrix enhance internal talent mobility, supporting career growth and smooth transitions into next-gen roles.
By 2025, our goal is to have at least 30.0% of our workforce, or over 13,000 employees, in 
next-gen roles across a minimum of 10 job families, reflecting skills of the future, aligned with our M25+ objectives and evolving industry demands.
Employee Engagement
In 2023, we recorded a 92% participation rate in the Employee Engagement Survey, with close to 39,000 Maybankers sharing insights. This achievement, along with our sixth recognition in Willis Towers Watson’s High Performance Companies benchmark, underscores our commitment to both financial excellence and superior human resources practices. Meanwhile, our Sustainable Engagement Index stands at 89%, as we continue to perform 
above the WTW Global High Performing Companies Norm.
Employee engagement is further enhanced by the Leaders Teaching Leaders series, led by 
our Group EXCOs. Encompassing initiatives, such as Conversations with C-Suite sessions, M25+ roadshows, and Group townhalls, the series creates a shared vision and ensures a clear line of sight, enabling employees to understand their role in achieving organisational goals. In 2023, our leaders facilitated 968 sessions.
In 2023, Maybank’s year-long employee volunteerism initiative witnessed Maybankers 
collectively investing 142,319 hours in both team-based and individual volunteering efforts. Through our Maybank Group Global Corporate Responsibility Day, 17,420 Maybankers came together to showcase their year-long efforts with 96 environmental and community projects in just a single day.
We also celebrated our inaugural Maybank Group Sustainability Week to showcase our 
sustainability achievements and inspire sustainable living at work and home. The five-day event featured a broad range of activities including a diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) panel session, sustainability workshops, and sharings from industry experts on sustainability best practices.
Employee Well-Being
Aligned with our M25+ strategy, our inclusive well-being approach promotes sustainable workforce development through proactive mental health initiatives. The Mental Well-being Roadshows, featuring educational modules, counselling and C.A.R.E. (Compassionate, Attentive, Respectful, Empathetic) Circles, help us to understand and address our employees’ needs more effectively.
Key well-being initiatives undertaken this year include:•
 73 mental well-being roadshows and outreach sessions were conducted, aimed at 
enhancing mental health literacy and equipping Maybankers with well-being strategies, recording 14,504 instances of participation. 
•
 Introduced three comprehensive mental health modules for targeted segments of our workforce.
•
 Certified an additional 95 Maybankers as Mental Health First Aiders (MHFAs), bringing our total number of certified MHFAs to 195 to offer private counselling sessions for our people. In 2023, a total of 407 sessions were conducted in-person and over Zoom.
•
 Since its launch in 2021, the Quarterly Step + Sleep Challenge has seen an increase in participation, reaching 10,721 participants in 2023. This reflects our commitment to a healthy lifestyle and rewarding eligible Maybankers with well-being leave.
Learning and Development
Aligned with global trends and industry shifts, we invested RM129.89 million (FY2022: RM110.90 million) to accelerate our upskilling journey and ensure Maybankers are future-ready and Agile via increased learning engagements across the Group which includes remote learning platforms that provide access to learning programmes, anytime, anywhere when needed.
The number of unique learners for the year stands at 40,622 (FY2022: 41,831) with a total of 
506,478 (FY2022: 573,170) learning programmes undertaken, averaging 12 (FY2022: 13) programmes per employee.
The M25+ Unlimited Potential programme, with an investment of RM12.30 million, upskills leaders 
for immediate results and Group-wide collaboration, contributing to an estimated business impact of RM257.89 million. Meanwhile, the Chief Financial Officer Accelerator Lab equips finance leaders to align business intent with our values amid dynamic business landscapes.

We are also collaborating with the United Nations Global Compact for Malaysia & Brunei to 
develop the Maybank Sustainability Professional Certification Programme and have 24 
Maybankers enrolled into in-house sustainability certification programmes to build a talent pipeline of sustainability experts within the Bank.
Digital upskilling continues to be emphasised to ensure our workforce is not only adept at 
their current roles but also well-prepared for the digital future. Key initiatives to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of Maybankers in 2023 included the following:
•
 Implementation of generative AI in our digital sales and marketing learning programmes, 
leading to a 58.3% increase in sales leads generation.
• Generative AI, Metaverse, Web 3.0, Blockchain, Non Fungible Tokens, and Central Bank Digital Currencies programmes, which attracted 317 participants and inspired innovative ideas.
•
 Our Digital Market Intelligence programme, launched across all eight CFS regions in Malaysia, surpassed our internal target set for the year by 98.0% and we had utilised generative AI to train staff which resulted in a 61.8% increase in sales lead generation.
•
 Expansion of our upskilling programmes in analytics, with 1,041 employees applying skills learnt for greater work efficiencies and business insights.
•
 Launch of the Interactive Data Visualisation and Data Storytelling with Oracle Analytics Server programme, enabling access to a single platform for all dashboards in the Bank for actionable insights. This initiative saw 134 employees trained, with plans to expand participation next year.
Nurturing Talent
In 2023, we onboarded 2,656 graduates and undergraduates through diverse entry-level roles, pipeline and government-initiated programmes including Protégé, Global Maybank Apprentice Programme, Relationship Manager Development Programme and Next Expert in Technology (NExT). Additionally, targeted training for undergraduates continued through the General Internship Programme, Techies Internship Programme, Maybank Young Bankers Internship Programme and Sales Internship.

pg. 151-160Group Human Capital REMUNERATION
Maybank Group’s total rewards management remains core to our remuneration 
approach and practices and is strongly aligned with our business and people strategies to deliver long-term sustainable returns to our shareholders, customers and other stakeholders. It is a strategic human capital sustainability component of the integrated Talent Management Framework, which enables differentiated rewards for talent retention and attraction by providing the right remuneration, benefits and career development/progression opportunities at the right time for our people to achieve personal and professional aspirations. At the same time, it ensures we are positioned to increase staff engagement, drive positive outcomes and deliver exponential business results responsibly.
This upholds our M25+ purpose to be “a values-driven platform, powered by 
a bionic workforce that humanises financial services”. By focusing on the right compensation, benefits and development support, we inspire our employees to achieve their personal and professional aspirations which, in turn, improves employee productivity and engagement.
Our Total Rewards Framework is firmly anchored in the principles of pay for 
performance and affordability, ensuring that our talented workforce is rewarded in a manner that is equitable, reasonable and in line with relevant indices within each respective country. We are committed to maintaining competitiveness against our peers and competitors in the market, while embracing the importance of differentiation to contribute positively to diversity, balance and overall relevance. Simultaneously, we uphold the principles of fairness, respect and equality in all aspects of our business practices, including remuneration of our employees. This reflects our commitment to foster a work environment where all employees are valued and rewarded fairly for their unique and invaluable contributions.
We continue to accelerate our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) 
and sustainability commitments by incorporating ESG in various aspects of our total rewards management through proper governance, performance measurement standards and prudent risk management considerations. Governed by sound principles, our remuneration policies and practices are reviewed periodically to ensure alignment with regulatory requirements and to reinforce a high-performance culture. 
Components of Remuneration
Maybank Group adopts a well-rounded Total Rewards Framework that encompasses three integral pillars: total compensation, benefits and well-being, and development and career opportunities. 
i)
 Total Compensation
Maybank Group’s Compensation Policy ensures that our employees are paid 
in line with prevailing market standards. Our differentiated compensation levels are kept competitive through annual salary reviews, variable bonuses and long-term incentive plans (for eligible senior management and above) to retain, motivate and reward our talents.
Our holistic approach to total compensation is structured around two core 
elements, fixed pay and variable pay, the latter consisting of variable bonuses and long-term incentive awards. This dynamic framework is designed to reflect targeted pay mix levels, intricately calibrated to align with the long-term performance goals and objectives of the organisation while simultaneously motivating and rewarding our employees in a manner that befits their outstanding efforts and achievements. ii)
 Benefits and Well-being
Employee benefits are integral to our total rewards management, dovetailing seamlessly with our 
commitment to ESG values and our M25+ strategic objectives. Maybank's comprehensive benefits 
programme is designed to offer financial security, healthcare coverage, paid time off, employee loans at preferential rates, and other perks and benefits that facilitate work-life balance. We regularly review these offerings, ensuring they remain competitive and aligned with industry standards amid the ever-evolving business landscape. Presenteeism and poor well-being carry high consequences, resulting in financial losses on top of treatment expenses. We recognise this and ensure employees have access to diverse support. We have certified 195 Mental Health First Aiders since 2022, who provide assistance to Maybankers across regions and countries, complementing our Mental Wellbeing department. In 2023, 34,556 hours were clocked on mental health support, with 480 sessions, and 14,504 instances of participation.
Our approach is holistic, intertwining sustainability principles with the well-being of our employees. 
This is to cater to our employees’ physical, mental and emotional well-being, as well as their financial, social and career needs, underscoring our dedication to fostering a supportive and well-rounded work environment.
iii)
 Development and Career Opportunities
In line with our commitment to fostering a robust learning culture, we continue to deploy best-in-
class learning and development programmes that are flexible and tailored to nurture our employees across all levels. 
These programmes are designed to offer flexibility and customisation, ensuring that they remain 
relevant for the long term, enhance our competitive edge, and promote sustained growth. One of the 
outcomes we have continued to track for over a decade now is the internal realisation rate which is a target of eight in 10 vacancies filled by internal talent, demonstrating real growth. Fixed Pay
• Attract and retain talents by providing competitive and equitable pay.
• Reviewed annually using a holistic approach through internal and external benchmarking against 
relevant peers/locations, taking into consideration market dynamics, differences in individual responsibilities, functions/roles, performance levels, skillsets as well as competency levels.
 Variable Pay
Variable Bonus:•
 Reinforce a pay-for-performance culture and adherence to Maybank Group’s core values, TIGER. 
• Variable cash award design that is aligned with the risk management and long-term performance goals of the Group through our deferral and clawback policies. 
•
 Based on the overall performance of the Group, business/corporate function and individual. 
• Premised on the balanced scorecard (BSC) approach (comprising financial and non-financial KPIs) that is tailored to drive desired behaviours and performance levels in creating long-term shareholder value.
Long-Term Incentive Award: A significant component of senior management’s total compensation with the intent to drive sustainable, longer-term risk management and to meet the Group’s M25+ strategy.Deferral Policy: Any variable bonus in excess of certain thresholds will be deferred over a period of time. 
A deferred variable bonus will lapse immediately upon termination of employment (including resignation) except in the event of ill health, disability, redundancy, retirement or death.Clawback Provision: Maybank’s Board has the right to make adjustments or clawbacks to any variable bonus or long-term incentive award if deemed appropriate based on risk management issues, financial misstatement, fraud, gross negligence or wilful misconduct.

Employees’ Share Grant Plan (ESGP)
The existing ESGP was rolled out in December 2018 and will expire in 2025. A total of five awards have been made under the existing ESGP from 2018 to 2022. Three out of these five awards 
have been vested to eligible employees in 2021 to 2023 while the two remaining awards will vest in 2024 and 2025 respectively. The last (i.e.: fifth) tranche of the ESGP Award under the existing plan was made in September 2022 and will vest in 2025. Starting from 2023, no additional awards will be issued to staff under the existing ESGP.
To maintain our commitment to rewarding sustainable performance and ensure the continuity of our LTIP from 2023 onwards, we introduced a new scheme on 20 September 2023 for 
eligible talents and senior management. The new ESGP is valid for 10 years and will expire in 2033. The first award under the new ESGP, made in September 2023, will vest in 2026 subject to fulfilment of the vesting conditions as well as the performance criteria at the Maybank Group and individual levels.
Governance and Controls – Remuneration PracticesWe maintain strong corporate governance practices with remuneration policies and practices that comply with all statutory and regulatory requirements, and are strengthened by sound 
risk management and controls, ensuring remuneration practices are carried out responsibly. 
The Group has strong internal governance on the performance and remuneration of control functions which are measured and assessed independently of the business units to avoid any 
conflict of interest. The remuneration of employees in control functions is predominantly fixed to reflect the nature of their responsibilities. Annual reviews of their compensation are benchmarked internally and against the market to ensure they are competitive. 
Based on sound performance management principles, our key performance indicators (KPIs) continue to focus on outcomes and are aligned with our business plans. Each of the senior 
officers and other material risk takers (OMRTs) carries risk, governance and compliance goals in his/her individual scorecards which are cascaded accordingly. The right KPI setting continues to shape our organisational culture while driving risk and compliance agendas effectively. Inputs from control functions and board committees are incorporated into the respective functional areas and individual performance results.
Senior Officers and Other Material Risk Takers (OMRTs) The remuneration of senior officers and OMRTs are reviewed annually and submitted to the Nomination and Remuneration Committee for recommendation to the Group Board for approval. The remuneration of Maybank Group’s senior officers and OMRTs in FY2023 are summarised in the table below:

Maybank Group delivered another year of commendable financial performance despite persisting headwinds in the operating 
environment from geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures and rising interest rates. The Bank focused on growth opportunities across its consumer and business segments within the ASEAN franchise, expanded its regional wealth management penetration and deployed sustainable financing solutions to customers.
Maybank continued to maintain a strong liquidity position to support assets growth across the region and made strategic investments 
to enhance IT capabilities as well as drive regional cross-selling synergies aligned with the M25+ plan. Asset quality recovery efforts remained a priority and enhanced asset quality management initiatives were undertaken to achieve a sustained lower net credit charge off rate of 31 bps. With these combined efforts, Maybank recorded a double-digit return on equity for the year.

pg. 6-14Maybank At A Glance Strong Loans Growth Across Our Home Markets
• In 2023, the Group gross loans expanded 9.2% YoY, driven mainly by steady growth from 
the Community Financial Services (CFS) franchise across our home markets and Global 
Banking (GB) operations in Singapore and Malaysia.
Malaysia
• Malaysia’s loans grew 6.7% supported by 7.2% growth from CFS contributed by consumer, 
retail SME (SME) and business banking (BB) lines. The consumer book rose 6.7% YoY, as 
mortgages grew 10.4% driven by the release of loan stocks, growth in residential properties and fast loan disbursements in the secondary market. Auto financing grew 9.0% YoY while credit cards also showed double-digit growth of 15.9% contributed by higher consumer spending. Retail SME and BB loans grew 9.0% YoY on a combined basis supported by better trade business and term loan disbursements. Meanwhile, the GB portfolio increased 5.9% YoY supported by term loan and trade financing growth.Record Profit Amid Softer Economic Landscape
•
 The Group’s net operating income (NOI) grew 3.3% YoY driven mainly by strong growth of 
38.3% in non-interest income (NOII), led by gains in treasury and markets income from the foreign exchange and investment and trading portfolios as well as better core fees. Core fees improvement came from higher service charges and fees, commission and 
underwriting fees.
•
 Meanwhile, net fund based income stood at RM19.30 billion in FY2023 versus RM20.67 billion as net interest margin (NIM) compressed 27 basis points (bps) YoY to 2.12% on higher funding costs led by interest rate hikes in 2022 and 2023 as well as continued deposit competition. 
•
 The Group’s cost to income ratio (CIR) stood at 48.9% in FY2023 as overheads grew 11.8% YoY on higher personnel costs arising from conclusion of collective agreements, IT related 
expenses and credit card related fees on higher billings and merchant volume as well as other general expenses in 2023.•
 Meanwhile, the Group’s net impairment losses reduced 39.5% to RM1.68 billion compared 
to RM2.78 billion in FY2022. This was led by a net writeback in financial investments and others of RM145.15 million, lower net loan provisioning of 16.3% to RM1.83 billion on writebacks of corporate borrowers in 2023 and pre-emptive provisioning made the year before.
•
 Following the higher net operating income growth and lower net impairment losses, profit 
before tax improved by 5.6% YoY to RM12.53 billion and net profit rose to a record high of 
RM9.35 billion in FY2023. Return on Equity (ROE) stood at 10.8%, meeting the Group’s guidance of between 10.5% and 11.0% for FY2023. 
•
 Maybank continued to reward its shareholders by declaring a total cash dividend of 60.0 sen per share for FY2023, which translates to a dividend payout of 77.4%. The current payout remains well ahead of our dividend payout policy rate of 40% to 60%.

Singapore
• In Singapore, our loan book improved 8.7% YoY mainly led by strong growth in GB of 16.0% 
while CFS grew 1.8% YoY. Corporate lending improved from growth in target segments such as financial institutions, large corporates, government-linked companies and conglomerates while CFS growth was driven by retail SME, BB and the auto portfolios.
Indonesia
•
 The loans growth of 6.2% YoY in Indonesia came predominantly from CFS’ growth of 9.7% 
mainly contributed by the auto, credit cards, personal loan and retail SME segments. The GB portfolio recorded minimal growth of 0.8% YoY due to early repayments by some borrowers and lending competition in the industry.

Customer Deposits Expansion Led by Home Markets 
• The Group’s deposits expanded 9.0% YoY led by growth of 
13.5%, 9.4% and 4.9% in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia respectively. While growth in Group deposits was led by total fixed deposits (FDs) growth of 11.2% to RM321.04 billion 
and other deposits such as money market deposits, the Group’s CASA deposits remained healthy at RM257.33 billion with a CASA ratio of 36.9%.
Malaysia•
 In Malaysia, CASA deposits were lower at RM185.95 billion from RM187.62 billion in FY2022 given increased consumer and business spending. Meanwhile, money market deposits grew 21.7% YoY to support our assets growth. Malaysia’s CASA ratio remained strong at 42.7% as at  
31 December 2023.
Singapore•
 In Singapore, CASA deposits reduced to SGD13.02 billion from SGD15.37 billion as customers used their funds for working capital needs and opted for higher yielding deposits, which in turn supported FD growth of 27.0% YoY. Overall, Singapore’s total deposits grew by 13.5% YoY with a CASA ratio of 23.8%.
Indonesia•
 Meanwhile, Indonesia’s CASA grew by 8.6% YoY to IDR58.75 trillion driven by current account deposits growth across retail and non-retail segments as well as increased operating accounts through cash management and digital banking solutions. FD also increased by 10.2% as customers sought higher earning deposits. The CASA ratio remained healthy at 50.9% as at 31 December 2023.Healthy Asset Quality Trends Across Markets
•
 The Group’s total loan loss provisioning for FY2023 
decreased by 16.3% YoY to RM1.83 billion from RM2.18 billion 
due to writebacks of corporate borrowers in 2023 and pre-emptive provisioning made the year before. Provisions 
made for FY2023 were mainly on new and existing impaired accounts. 
•
 We maintained management overlays of RM1.70 billion, with 60% allocated to the retail and retail SME portfolios in anticipation of emerging asset quality risks from the current economic environment. 
•
 The Group’s annualised net credit charge off rate improved to 31 bps from 40 bps in FY2022, meeting the Group’s guidance of between 30 bps and 35 bps for FY2023.
•
 Our loan loss coverage ratio stood at 124.9% from 131.2% a year ago while gross impaired loans (GIL) ratio improved to 1.34% as at 31 December 2023 from 1.57% a year ago due to write-offs, recoveries and reclassification of accounts to non-impaired.
•
 In 2023, we continued to see the expiry of loans under relief, restructuring and rescheduling (R&R) as well as repayment assistance programmes arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in Malaysia and Singapore. As at 31 January 2024, total loans under relief in Malaysia and Indonesia reduced to 0.6% and 5.2% respectively. Meanwhile, there are no longer any loans under these COVID-19 related relief programmes in Singapore. CASA

SUMMARY OF SEGMENTAL PERFORMANCE
• Group Community Financial Services recorded a strong NOI growth of 8.3% YoY on higher net fund based income 
and NOII. Net fund based income rose 7.4% on loans growth of 8.0% while NOII expanded 11.2%. Total deposits growth of 9.1% was mainly led by fixed deposits. Meanwhile, overheads rose 13.0% while net loan loss provisions increased, resulting in lower PBT of 9.9% to RM5.71 billion against RM6.34 billion in FY2022. 
•
 Group Global Banking posted lower NOI by 6.1% to RM9.39 billion as net fund based income reduced 9.6% on higher funding costs and NOII eased 0.7% on lower trading and brokerage income. Overheads increased 7.8% but mitigated by the 87.5% decrease in net impairment losses for loans and securities. As a result, PBT increased 18.8% to RM5.95 billion. 
•
 Group Insurance and Takaful’s NOI more than doubled to RM1.16 billion in FY2023 on higher net investment income, combined gross premiums/contributions from its general business and net adjusted premiums/ contributions from growth in its regular premium new business products. Total assets improved 18.5% to RM58.81 billion from RM49.65 billion in FY2022.
•
 Group Islamic Banking’s NOI was lower by 2.0% YoY at RM7.51 billion as net fund based income reduced on higher funding costs. The lower NOI was mitigated by an increase of 60.7% in non-fund based income driven by gains in the treasury and markets portfolio. Overheads increased 26.0% from higher shared services cost while impaired provisions also rose 91.6%, resulting in a PBT decline of 26.7% to RM3.49 billion.

EFFECTIVE CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT
Well-Diversified Funding Profile and Strong Liquidity Position
• Our liquidity is managed proactively across the Group in order to ensure the ability to meet financial obligations and to 
conduct business even under stressed situations. We conduct frequent reviews of balance sheet management strategies which include the funding needs of the Group, taking into account liquidity risk levels, market competitiveness and economic outlook.
•
 Through our Agile funding strategy, we were able to maintain healthy liquidity risk indicators, with liquidity coverage ratio 
(LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) at 142.1% and 122.0% respectively as at 31 December 2023, above Bank Negara 
Malaysia (BNM)’s regulatory minimum LCR and NSFR requirements of 100%. In addition, our other liquidity indicators such as loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) remained robust at 91.7% as at 31 December 2023.
•
 The Group and its major subsidiaries and overseas branches have established Recovery Plans (RCPs) in line with BNM’s and Perbadanan Insurans Deposit Malaysia (PIDM)’s policy framework for recovery and resolution planning for financial institutions in Malaysia. The RCPs identify credible options to recover from events impacting the Group’s financial strength, liquidity position and operational capability. RCPs provide a systematic approach to address potential capital, liquidity or funding disruptions affecting the financial solvency of the Group. RCPs encompass clear strategies, decision-making authorities, roles and responsibilities, and communications. Key components of each plan include strategic analysis, governance structure and oversight, recovery indicators, recovery options and preparatory measures, scenario analysis as well as communications and disclosures. The Group is committed to continuously enhancing our recovery and 
resolution capabilities in line with the requirements set by BNM and PIDM.

 Our key capital and funding initiatives during FY2023 included the following:
– We continued to broaden and diversify our funding and capital raising through various 
sources, currencies, investors and markets. This included the issuance of fixed and floating rate notes in domestic and foreign currencies, such as Samurai bonds, SGD and USD extendible money market certificates, MYR and USD commercial papers, structured notes and other foreign currency denominated medium term notes.
–
 Optimised and restructured the capital mix of the subsidiaries and overseas branches as part of the ongoing Group-wide capital optimisation and restructuring exercise.
–
 Optimised our risk-weighted assets (RWA) across the Group. This included process improvements, refining the computation methodologies and enhancing internal policies to ensure the RWA reflects the risk profile of the Group’s balance sheet, products and services.
–
 Enhanced balance sheet management and oversight via ongoing implementation of Maybank Group Investment Management Framework.

OUTLOOK AND PRIORITIES FOR 2024
As we move into 2024, we remain steadfast in our pursuit of new loan growth opportunities regionally while ensuring optimal funding through diversification and defending our CASA balances to support asset growth. Focus growth areas include wealth management, cash management and bancassurance while broadening market penetration in the non-retail segments, especially among small and medium enterprises and mid-market companies. Concurrently, the Group will continue its M25+ momentum to drive better productivity and efficiency, improve customer experience, digital offerings, IT infrastructure, and sustainability capabilities. Asset quality management will remain a priority for the Group, as we remain vigilant over our loan portfolios and some borrowers, particularly SME customers.

pg. 24-71Our Approach and Key Enablers to Value Creation
pg. 6-14Maybank At A GlanceInvestor Information INVESTORS’ KEY FOCUS AREAS
01
Macroeconomic 
and banking industry outlook, trends and policiesWe closely monitor global trends, including economic growth, 
inflation and geopolitical dynamics while focusing on regional trends, particularly in our home markets. This includes an in-depth examination of regional GDP growth, market stability, and economic updates, which allow us to adapt to interest rate trends while ensuring that our customers continue to benefit from competitive lending rates. Our robust management of the loan portfolio and interest rate risk serves to safeguard our customers’ financial well-being in a dynamic interest rate environment.
02
M25+ strategy 
and long-term growth prioritiesWe empower collaboration while inculcating a “fail fast” mindset, applying an iterative Minimum Viable Product approach for swift adaptation to market changes. Guided by market insights, our customer-centric development includes improved user-friendly mobile apps and online banking solutions for faster time to market and better customer experience. A full realisation of M25+ will holistically transform Maybank’s performance, with continued emphasis on BAU initiatives.
03
Income and growth driversWe are committed to grow in ASEAN, focusing on building our CFS franchise business strength in areas such mortgage, RSME, and SME+ offerings. For Global Banking, we seek to deepen account planning by cutting across segments, products and countries. We aim to expand regional wealth management penetration and bolster the Islamic wealth management proposition. Our commitment to sustainability includes the deployment of our sustainable financing and decarbonisation solutions, aligning with evolving customer needs and global environmental goals.
07
DigitalisationMaybank aims to be a leader in digital banking, fostering a digital business and culture beyond online services. We developed next-gen technology capabilities via M-INSIGHTS, a platform that facilitates hyper-personalisation and business outcomes, and M-CONNECT, an API-enabled digital platform to drive regional business expansion and partnerships. The Agile Customer Experience (CX) @ Branch initiative simplifies the account opening process, standardises service quality and enhances our infrastructure for faster, hassle-free transactions and an overall better experience for customers.
08
Shareholder returnsMaybank continues to provide strong shareholder returns with a total dividend payout ratio of 77.4% for FY2023, well above our official dividend payout policy rate of 40% to 60%. We continue to work on improving our capital efficiency through optimisation of risk-weighted assets, among others, to maximise shareholder returns.
04
Outlook on cost, M25+ spend and operational efficiencies Operational efficiency is achieved through digitalisation, automation and process enhancements, reducing redundancies and improving productivity. Planned technology investments for business and back-end enhancements are in line with average investment spend by top regional banks, ensuring sustainable long-term profitability of the Group.
06
ESG framework, 
decarbonisation and transition progress for high ESG risk sectorsOur sustainability frameworks, policies and guidelines drive ESG 
integration for long-term value creation. As the first Malaysian bank to establish a financed emissions baseline, we are committed to proactively engage with our customers and help them in their transition journey to decarbonise, which includes providing green financing or renewable energy solutions.

Group Community Financial Services’ profit before tax (PBT) declined 9.9% YoY due to higher overheads and net loan 
loss provisions despite an increase of 8.3% in net operating income (NOI):
• NOI rose to RM16.91 billion as net fund based income grew 7.4% and non-interest income (NOII) expanded 11.2%.
• Higher net fund based income was led by stronger loans growth of 8.0% YoY vs FY2022’s 6.5%, driven by consumer and 
commercial loans at 7.0% and 11.6% respectively.
• Deposit growth of 9.1% YoY led by fixed deposits. As competition for CASA remained intense, the CASA ratio declined to 48.1% from 51.6% a year earlier.
•
 NOII growth of 11.2% YoY driven mainly by card fees and payments.
• Offset by higher overheads of 13.0% YoY mainly from personnel cost and information technology (IT) spend related to business growth.
•
 Net loan loss provisions increased due to impairment from commercial and retail loans.
In Malaysia, PBT declined 23.0% YoY to RM4.09 billion, attributed to:
• Overheads increase of 15.4% YoY from personnel, IT expenditure and fees and brokerage.
• Net loan loss provisions increase of >100% mainly from auto, retail and commercial portfolios.
• Mitigated by higher NOI of 4.4% YoY led by NOII rise of 16.7% from card fees, payments and bancassurance. 
• Strong loans growth of 7.2% YoY driven from mortgage, auto and commercial portfolios. 
• Deposits growth of 3.7% contributed mainly from fixed deposits.
For international operations, we recorded a commendable growth of 57.9% YoY in PBT, attributed to:
• Singapore: PBT growth of 79.1% YoY as NOI grew 21.3% YoY. Offset by 8.6% YoY decrease in NOII as market sentiment 
and high interest rate environment weighed on investment and bancasurance growth.
• Indonesia: PBT growth of 29.8% YoY driven by higher net fund based income and NOII of 10.2% and 8.5% respectively. Prudent cost management resulted in improved CIR from 72.5% to 71.2%. Steady loans growth of 9.8% YoY underpinned by growth in auto and commercial portfolios.
•
 Philippines: PBT growth of 54.6% YoY on NOI growth of 3.5% YoY and lower loan loss provisions. Strong loans growth at 
27.9% YoY driven by auto and mortgage portfolios at 34.2% and 22.5% respectively.
Offset by:
• Cambodia: PBT declined 52.0% YoY on intense deposit competition and liquidity pressure which led to slowdown of 
asset growth.

2023KEY PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS FY2023
Group Insurance and Takaful’s PBT improved by >100.0% YoY to RM977.50 million, resulting from:
• Growth in net investment income driven by realised and unrealised gains from the fixed income portfolio following the 
drop in bond yields during the year.
• 3.6% growth to RM11.48 billion in combined gross premiums/contributions driven by strong double-digit growth in general business, though moderated by lower single premium sales due to a deliberate shift in focus towards longer-term sustainable solutions with higher margins. Net adjusted premiums/contributions increased 10.0% to RM6.84 billion contributed mainly by the strong growth in regular premium new business products.
•
 16.0% increase to RM4.96 billion in general insurance and takaful premiums/contributions supported by growth in all 
classes.
• Offset by 4.2% contraction to RM6.52 billion in life insurance and family takaful premiums/contributions mainly due to lower single premiums.
•
 Total assets increased 18.5% YoY to RM58.81 billion from RM49.65 billion in FY2022.
In Malaysia, PBT grew by 38.7% YoY to RM1.08 billion arising from:
• Increased net investment income due to fair value gain from the fixed income portfolio following the drop in bond yields.
• 15.0% growth to RM8.65 billion in combined gross premiums/contributions supported by an increase in single premiums 
from life business. However, lower insurance/takaful service results due to higher claims.
• 14.7% growth in general insurance and takaful business driven by production from all classes of business.
• 15.3% growth in life insurance and family takaful premiums/contributions from higher single premiums and credit business.
•
 New business value of life insurance and family takaful business grew 29.1% to RM182.28 million from RM141.24 million.
For international operations, loss before taxation (LBT) reduced from RM620.94 million to RM98.04 million due to:
• 91.6% reduction in Singapore LBT from RM618.26 million to RM51.85 million. In FY2022, Singapore’s life business was 
affected by impairment losses on provisions for China bonds, negative impact from yield movement as well as losses due to high surrenders of single Mini Universal Life products. However, gross premiums from Singapore reduced 29.0% to RM2.06 billion mainly due to lower single premiums.
•
 Indonesia recorded a reduced LBT of RM10.65 million compared to RM13.23 million in FY2022 due to the release of premium reserve and higher investment income combined with a 3.2% growth in gross premiums to RM206.48 million.
•
 Offset by Philippines’ LBT of RM24.91 million as underwriting profit was driven down by higher claims, particularly in health insurance although gross premiums grew 21.1% to RM562.55 million.
•
 Cambodia’s LBT increased to RM10.63 million from RM10.05 million as the underwriting deficit expanded although gross premiums grew 42.0% to RM22.00 million from RM15.50 million in FY2022.
OUTLOOK AND PRIORITIES FOR 2024
Based on Malaysia’s Budget 2024, the National Energy Transition Roadmap and New Industrial Master Plan 2030, there are many opportunities for the general insurance business in identified growth areas. These include the expansion of renewable energy (RE) projects, strengthening of the electricity transmission network, provision of data centres leveraging RE and the promotion of Malaysia as an EV hub. As the leading corporate insurer in Malaysia with an indicative 30.0% market share, Etiqa is well positioned to tap into this renewed optimism in corporate Malaysia. We will also leverage our leadership in motor takaful to provide the protection needs of Tesla and Pronet vehicles as they roll out their EV cars. Finally, consolidation of the insurance industry in Malaysia may see increased competition for market share in the short term.
In the medium term, digital insurance and takaful operators may enter the Malaysian insurance space by 2026. In preparation for new competition, Etiqa will strengthen our digital 
offerings. Meanwhile, over the longer run, we are stepping up efforts to standardise our digital platform across ASEAN to ensure the ability to offer the best products and services across the region. FY2022 financials have been restated due to adoption of MFRS 17.

Gross FinancingKEY PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS FY2023
Maybank Group Islamic Banking’s PBT declined by 26.7% YoY to RM3.49 billion on lower net operating income (NOI), 
higher overheads and net impairment provisions:
• NOI decreased by 2.0% to RM7.51 billion from lower net fund based income (NFBI) arising from higher funding cost given 
the rising interest rate environment.
• Overheads increased 26.0% mainly from Maybank Islamic Berhad (MIB) due to higher shared services cost, resulting in cost to income ratio (CIR) increasing to 39.3% from 30.5%.
•
 Asset quality and impairments are proactively managed by taking a forward looking view. This resulted in impairment provisions increasing 91.6% due to higher expected credit losses for the retail portfolio coupled with higher management 
overlay applied in key markets such as Malaysia and Singapore. 
•
 Meanwhile, total gross financing and financing managed by the Bank grew by 10.3% driven by 9.2% in Malaysia, 40.2% in Singapore and 20.5% in Indonesia. Deposits and unrestricted Investment Accounts (UA) grew by 3.5%, driven by 68.7% growth in Singapore.
•
 The decline in NOI was offset by an increase of 60.7% in non-fund based income (NoFBI) mainly from higher foreign exchange (forex) gain and sale of securities. NoFBI ratio stood at 19.7%, up from 12.0% the year before.
In Malaysia, PBT declined by 30.2% YoY to RM3.17 billion on lower NOI, higher overheads and net impairment provisions:
•
 NOI decreased by 3.7% as MIB’s NFBI contracted by 12.5% while funding cost increased in a rising interest rate 
environment although financing assets grew.
• Overheads increased 26.7% in Malaysia, resulting in CIR increasing to 39.9% from 30.3% while net impairment provisions increased by >100% mainly for SME and corporate borrowers.
•
 MIB’s gross financing and financing managed by the Bank increased 9.2% led by mortgage, auto, term and trade financing, while deposits and UA grew by 1.1%.
•
 The decline in NOI was offset partially by an increase of 61.1% in NoFBI from higher forex gains and sale of securities.
For international operations, PBT improved by 45.3% YoY to RM320.59 million as:
• Singapore’s PBT rose 51.7% YoY on higher NOI despite an increase in net impairment provisions. NOI grew 68.5% driven 
by higher NFBI of 79.6% as financing assets grew 40.2% led by CFS’ retail SME and Commercial Banking portfolios while concerted effort was made to grow affordable deposits such as retail low-cost CASA and cheaper term deposits.

 Indonesia’s Unit Usaha Syariah (UUS) recorded a PBT growth of 44.1% despite increased overheads as net impairment provisions was lower. Although UUS’s NFBI decreased 3.4%, its NOI increased 0.7% driven by an increase in NoFBI by 40.6% from higher takaful commissions and sales gain of government bonds.

 Overall, PPOP from international operations increased by 18.1%.
OUTLOOK AND PRIORITIES FOR 2024
Global economic growth in 2024 is expected to moderate due to the tight monetary policy environment, ongoing geopolitical tensions, and China’s modest economic recovery. Nevertheless, the Islamic finance industry is projected to grow around 10.0% in 2024, with market share expanding in key markets of Malaysia and Indonesia. Growth in 2024 will be driven largely by core markets in ASEAN and the Middle East, supported by robust demand for Islamic financial products and services.
Alignment between Islamic financial values and sustainability practices is expected to benefit industry growth due to investor demand, accelerating support for the global energy 
transition, and Islamic countries seeking to reduce their carbon footprints. Islamic wealth management, digital banking, the halal economy and sustainability continue to be strategic priorities as we build our global leadership in Islamic finance.Restated FY2022 comparative NOI and PBT due to change in fund

To foster long-term sustainable growth within Maybank, sustainability has been embedded 
as a strategic thrust under the M25+ plan. Our mission of Humanising Financial Services underpins an aspiration to drive change by generating meaningful impacts and delivering value across the six capitals, propelled by our sustainability strategy. 
In our sustainability journey, we have steadily incorporated ESG considerations into our 
strategic business decisions and practices. Our sustainability journey has embraced a pragmatic approach, involving a thorough review and adjusting aspects such as industry positions, risk acceptance criteria (RACs), frameworks and policies. The progress so far demonstrates our commitment to meeting diverse stakeholder expectations while steadfastly pursuing our mission to humanise financial services and contribute to the transition to a net zero future.
LEADERSHIP FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE
In our pursuit to become the regional sustainability leader, we aspire to create significant positive impact by promoting the mobilisation of capital towards sustainable development. Our efforts will be channelled into sustainable finance, the transition to low-carbon economy and enhanced community well-being through financial inclusion and community empowerment initiatives. In FY2023, we strengthened our decarbonisation journey and engaged actively with the industry on thought leadership, as well as with our customers on their transition pathways. We continued to walk the talk by upskilling our talent and building capacity in sustainability.
OUR SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY
Maybank has developed four holistic sustainability commitments, which are anchored on three robust pillars. As one of the strategic thrusts within M25+, these commitments also serve as our key focus areas aimed at driving our leadership position in the sustainability agenda. The four commitments are ingrained in our corporate culture and are reflected in our multifaceted approach to environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives.

ValuesBoardGroup General Counsel & Company Secretary 
and Joint Company SecretaryThe Board of Directors of Maybank (the Board) emphasises the importance of strong corporate governance (CG) in enhancing operational efficiency, increasing capital accessibility, 
managing risks, and overseeing business activities effectively. Long-term adherence to good CG practices ensures accountability, transparency, and value creation for all its stakeholders. 
OUR CG FRAMEWORK
Our CG Framework was built on the foundation of trust and integrity and is designed to establish the right balance of authority, empowerment and accountability between the Board and the Management. The framework is based on legal requirements, best practices, policies and guidelines issued by our regulators and is reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that we take into account the latest developments in the CG landscape. 
SUMMARY OF CG PRACTICES
This CG Overview Statement summarises the Group’s CG practices during FY2023. Details on how we have applied the best practices recommended by the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance 2021 (MCCG 2021) are set out in the CG Report which is available on Maybank Group’s corporate website at www.maybank.com. As at 31 December 2023, Maybank has applied all recommended practices in the MCCG 2021 save for Practice 8.2 and Step-up 8.3 (with regard to disclosure of senior management’s remuneration).A. BOARD LEADERSHIP AND EFFECTIVENESS

A description of the roles and responsibilities of the Board can be found in our Board Charter which is available on Maybank Group’s corporate website at www.maybank.com. 
To ensure the continuous identification and evaluation of various risks associated with the Group’s business and operations, the Board has

Progress of M25+•
 Periodic updates were tabled and discussed on the progress of the 12 strategic programmes (SP) established under M25+ which are based on the Agile ways of 
working. Key deliverables and outcome of these 12 SPs were assessed and measured throughout the year. 
• Key emphasis was placed on recalibrating staff mindset in the midst of change management and the need to inspire staff to work together to achieve the goals and objectives of M25+.
Senior Leadership and Board Succession Planning With the assistance of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee (NRC):•
 Several discussions were held to identify and select suitable talents to replace key senior personnel upon their retirement/expiry of employment contracts. These appointments were preceded by several months of rigorous search and identification of potential internal as well as external talents across the region. A Board Interview Panel made up of selected Board members and led by the Chairman of the NRC was also formed to interview shortlisted candidates. 
•
 Several talents were identified and included in the Board’s talent pool for succession planning, as the Board seeks to refresh its membership based on those who are 
expected to step down after completing their respective nine-year tenure within the next three years. 
 
Oversight of Banking Fraud and Data Breach Incidents•
 Quarterly updates with respect to key statistics on fraud and scam activities as well as data breach incidents impacting customers were tabled and discussed, to 
gain better understanding of the latest trends of financial scams as well as the measures taken by the Bank to combat online banking fraud.
• The Board was represented by the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director (SINED), who joined the meetings of the Taskforce on Oversight Banking Fraud and Data Breach Incidents (Taskforce) formed by the Management, to provide timely advice and assistance as needed, to address online fraud activities encountered by the Bank.

The roles and responsibilities of the Chairman and the President and Group CEO are clearly separated by a clear division of responsibilities which are defined and approved by the Board 
in line with best practices to ensure the appropriate supervision of Management. This distinction allows for better understanding and distribution of jurisdictional responsibilities and accountabilities. The Board has also selected certain members to undertake additional responsibilities with the following key functions:
Senior Independent Director (SID)•
To chair the NRC; and
•To address concerns of shareholders andstakeholders which may be conveyed to him.Senior Independent Non-Executive Director (SINED)•
To strengthen oversight of the Bank’s managementof banking fraud and data breach incidents; and
•
To act as Advisor of the Taskforce on Oversight ofBanking Fraud and Data Breach Incident.INED in-charge of Whistleblowing Policy•
To ensure effective implementation of MaybankGroup’s Whistleblowing Policy; and
•
To chair the Whistleblowing Committee.
The Board is assisted by two Company Secretaries (both with legal qualifications and are qualified to act as company secretary) who ensure that Board members receive appropriate and timely information including meeting materials and minutes. All Directors have access to the advice of the Company Secretaries and the Bank provides access, at its expense, to the services of independent professional advisers in order to facilitate the Directors in their role. 
Board Committees 
Recognising the vital role of technology in the Group’s business strategy (focusing on digital acceleration and technological modernisation as one of the strategic thrusts of M25+), the Board established the Board Technology Committee (BTC) in January 2024. This brings the total number of Board Committees to seven. Each Board Committee has its own TOR which clearly sets out its remit and decision-making powers. The chair of each Board Committee provides a report (to the Board) on salient matters discussed. The TOR of each Board Committee is also reviewed periodically, with the last review undertaken during FY2023. Amendments are made (where necessary) to ensure that the TORs of the Board Committees are updated with the latest best practices, processes and/or procedures prescribed or recommended by the regulators and are of market standard. As required under the Listing Requirements, the TORs of the NRC and the ACB as well as the Board Charter are available on Maybank Group’s corporate website at www.maybank.com.

including but not limited to the Maybank Group Code of Ethics and Conduct Policy, Maybank Group Whistleblowing Policy & Procedures, and Maybank Group Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy & Procedures. These policies are periodically reviewed to ensure the Group’s CG Framework remains robust and is continually updated. 
Sustainability 
Our commitment to driving Maybank’s sustainability agenda from the top is reaffirmed with the establishment of a sustainability governance structure in 2021, as depicted in the diagram below. This has enabled us to drive engagement on sustainability issues among the Board and senior management team, to set the Group’s direction and monitor progress of the Group’s sustainability agendas as predicated on three key overarching pillars, namely: 1. Responsible Transition, 2. Enabling Our Communities, and 3. Our House is in Order and We Walk The Talk.

pg. 151-160 Corporate Governance Overview Statement Board Appointment 
The NRC plays a major role in the nomination and selection 
process of potential candidates for appointment to the Boards of Maybank and its subsidiaries. The nomination and appointment of new Directors are guided by policies and processes as set out below:
1.
 Policy on Fit and Proper Criteria for Appointment/Re-
Appointment of Key Responsible Persons of Licensed 
Institutions in Maybank Group;
2. Policy on Nomination Process for Appointment of Chairman, Director and Chief Executive Officer of Licensed Institutions in Maybank Group (Policy on Nomination Process);
3.
 Policy on Tenure of Directorship;
4. Policy on Directors Independence; 
5. Policy on Board Gender Diversity; and
6. Policy on Directors Conflict of Interest.
Details of the above policies are provided in the CG Report.
The Policy on Nomination Process sets out a clear and 
transparent nomination and appointment process, as follows:
Stage 1 Identification of candidates
Stage 2 Engagement with candidates
Stage 3 Deliberation by the NRC
Stage 4 Recommendation to the Board
Succession Planning
The Board believes that effective succession planning mitigates the risks associated with the departure or absence of well-qualified and experienced individuals, and aims to ensure that the Board and senior management are always well-resourced with the right people in terms of skills and experience, in order to effectively and successfully deliver the Group’s strategy. 
As part of succession planning, the NRC has established a 
talent pool which comprises potential candidates to be considered for appointment as INEDs on the Boards of Maybank and its subsidiaries. From time to time, the NRC procures the curricula vitae of prospective candidates discreetly from various internal and external sources (i.e.: FIDE Forum) for its review and consideration. 
The NRC also reviews the talent pool regularly, in order to 
ensure that the Board will always have talent for selection whenever there is a need to appoint new directors. 
The Group’s Policy on the Tenure of Directorships (Directors 
Tenure Policy) facilitates succession planning by providing the Board with the opportunity to consider and reassess its membership periodically. This is to ensure continuity in meeting its long-term goals and objectives and also to ensure that the knowledge, experience and skillsets of its Board members are well-suited to meet the demands of an ever-changing financial industry. 
Details of changes to the Board composition during the year 
were as follows:
•
 Dr. Hasnita Dato’ Hashim was appointed as the SID of 
Maybank after Datuk R. Karunakaran retired from the 
Board at the 63rd Annual General Meeting (AGM) held in 
May 2023; and
• Following the conclusion of Mr Cheng Kee Check’s nine-
year tenure and his retirement as a Non-Executive Director in November 2023, Datuk Yee Yang Chien was appointed to the Board in the same month. 
Considering that several INEDs are expected to retire in the next two years upon completing their nine-year tenure on the Board, the NRC has commenced the search for potential candidates to fill the vacant Board seats based on the “Must Have” skillsets identified by the Board during the BEE exercise. To ensure boardroom diversity, the NRC has conducted a robust review of candidates recommended by Board members as well as by the appointed external search firm, before including them in the talent pool for future consideration. 
Fit and Proper 
All Directors must have the necessary qualities, competencies 
and experience that will allow them to perform their duties and carry out the responsibilities required of the position in the most effective manner. To assist the NRC in assessing and determining the fitness and propriety of Directors, the Board has established a Fit and Proper Policy (Maybank Group FAP Policy) which sets out the criteria for the FAP assessment and the process of re-election of Directors and selection of candidates for new appointment. The FAP assessment process covers the minimum fit and proper criteria as set out below:
(a)
 Probity, personal integrity and reputation  
Values that can be demonstrated through personal 
qualities such as honesty, integrity, diligence, independence of mind and fairness.
(b)
 Competency and capability  
Relevant skills, knowledge, experience and ability to understand the technical requirements of the business, the inherent risks and the management process required to perform the Director’s role.
(c)
 Financial integrity  
Ability to manage Director’s own financial affairs properly and prudently.
  Further details of the FAP assessment and criteria used for the 
said assessment are set out in the Maybank Group FAP Policy which is available on Maybank Group’s corporate website at www.maybank.com.Independence
In addition to the above FAP criteria, an independence 
assessment is also conducted on each INED based on the independence criteria set out in the following regulations/guidelines:
(a)
 BNM CG Policy;
(b) MCCG 2021; and
(c) Listing Requirements. 
To assist the NRC in evaluating the independence of INEDs, 
the Board has also established a Policy on Directors Independence which sets out the Board’s approach in determining directors’ independence and assessing the independence of each INED. 
Annual FAP and Independence AssessmentIn line with BNM’s FAP Guidelines as well as the Maybank 
Group FAP Policy, FAP and independence assessments on 
Maybank Directors are conducted annually as well as during the nomination and selection process for the appointment of new Directors, via the following processes:
(i)
 Execution of Director’s Self Declaration Form by individual 
Directors which includes:
• Declaration of non-disqualification of Director in 
accordance with Section 59 of the Financial Services Act 2013;
•
 Declaration of compliance with FAP Criteria pursuant to BNM and Maybank Group FAP Policy;
•
 Declaration of compliance with independence criteria for Independent Directors pursuant to:
(a)
 Paragraph 11.7 of BNM CG Policy;
(b) Paragraph 1.01 of Listing Requirements; and
(c) Maybank Group Policy on Directors Independence.
• Declaration of directorships outside of Maybank 
Group; 
• Declaration of conflict of interest with Maybank Group; and 
•
 Declaration of shareholding in Maybank Group.
(ii) Verification of Directors’ financial standing via 
bankruptcy search, CCRIS Report and Maybank’s internal Online Credit Information Search System (OCISS).
(iii)
 Verification of other directorships as well as litigation cases filed against Directors (if any) via CTOS search.
(iv)
 Verification of no adverse reports in respect of ethical and professional conduct/public exposure/legal suits based on checks conducted via the internet search 
engine as well as online legal report i.e.: Malaysian Law Journal and screening by an external background screening and verification company.
(v)

pg. 6-14Maybank At A GlanceCorporate Governance Overview Statement Based on the outcome of the FAP assessment conducted in 
FY2023, the NRC and the Board were satisfied that all Directors have met and fulfilled all the FAP and independence criteria set out in Maybank Group FAP Policy. Additionally, all the INEDs had, during the FAP assessment, declared and affirmed their independence and ability to act in an independent and objective manner. Each INED also has an ongoing obligation to inform the Board of any circumstances which could impair his or her independence.
Board Effectiveness Evaluation (BEE)The NRC assists the Board in reviewing its effectiveness, mix 
of skills and composition via the BEE exercise, which is conducted annually, and once every three years with the assistance of an independent firm of consultants. Findings from the BEE are used to establish the Board’s skills matrix, which is referred to by the Board and the NRC to support the Board’s succession planning activities, including strengthening of its talent pool with the right mix of skills and diversity in terms of gender and ethnicity. 
In 2017, the Board decided that the BEE exercise should be 
conducted by an independent firm of consultants once every three years. As an independent firm of consultants was last appointed by the Board to conduct the BEE for FY2020, the Board in FY2023 appointed Ernst and Young (EY) to undertake the BEE for FY2023 for Maybank and its key subsidiaries. The FY2023 BEE exercise was conducted in two phases:
Phase 1 – 
 Interviews with individual Directors and selected 
members of senior management to assess the effectiveness of the Board and Board Committees in the following broad areas:Phase 2 – 
 Questionnaire for Individual Director Self-Assessment and Peer Evaluation on the independence, contribution and commitment as well as competency, skills and expertise of the Directors (including Executive Director) 
The average ratings of all assessment areas remained positive (trended between satisfactory and strong), with a marginal increase in five areas while one area remained unchanged as compared to the last BEE. This indicates that the Board is performing well as a whole, with a strong level 
of independence and a satisfactory level of contribution, commitment, and competencies from all members.
Key strengths of the Board identified pursuant to the BEE 
conducted include the following:
(i)
 Positive Board culture and dynamics;
(ii) Strong leadership by the Board Chair; 
(iii) Healthy and open Board and Management interactions; 
(iv) Highly diverse and knowledgeable Directors; and
(v) Effective oversight in key areas of responsibility.
Apart from the above, there were certain areas of oversight 
highlighted which the Board needs to further consider, key among them were as follows:
(i)
 Realigning M25+ execution across subsidiaries and/or 
enhancing collaboration, communication and alignment across subsidiaries within the Group for better execution of M25+ strategies;
(ii)
 Improving Board composition by integrating more members with global exposure and strategic experience to promote the growth of the Group; and
(iii)
 Curating customised training programmes for Directors of Maybank Group, taking into consideration emerging topics and thematic issues impacting the organisation.
The action plans on the above focus areas will be developed and tabled to the Board for consideration and inclusion in the Board’s Actionable Improvement Programme (AIP) to be undertaken during FY2024. All matters under the AIP arising from the BEE for FY2022 were regularly tracked by the NRC and the Board until its completion in July 2023.
Directors’ Training The Board acknowledges the importance of continuing 
education for Directors to ensure that they are well-equipped 
with the necessary skills and knowledge to perform their duties and meet the challenges facing the Board. With the assistance of Group Corporate Secretarial (GCS), a Directors

(i)
 Cybersecurity;
(ii) Sustainability; and
(iii) Generative Artificial Intelligence.Training Calendar for FY2023 was prepared where all 
relevant internal and external trainings/ conferences/ seminars/ webinars were compiled and submitted to the 
Board every month for the Board’s information. 
During FY2023, all Board members attended various training 
programmes and workshops on issues relevant to the Group, among others on IT/cybersecurity, sustainable financing/ESG, and risk management (training needs identified via BEE for FY2022). In total, Board members collectively attended 852 hours of training in FY2023 (FY2022: 756 training hours). The trainings attended by Board 
members in FY2023 were tracked and presented to the Board on a monthly basis. The breakdown of training hours by topic is as per the chart below.

pg. 6-14Maybank At A GlanceCorporate Governance Overview Statement The NRC assists the Board in reviewing its remuneration framework via the Board Remuneration Review (BRR). The BRR is conducted annually, and once every three years with the assistance 
of an independent firm of consultants. As an independent firm of consultants was last appointed by the Board to conduct the BRR for FY2020, the Board had during FY2023 appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Malaysia to undertake the BRR for FY2023 to ascertain the competitiveness of the existing NED Remuneration Framework and its sufficiency to attract and retain talents to serve on the Board. The scope of the BRR exercise carried out by PwC was primarily based on a benchmarking of Maybank’s local and regional peers as well as a regression analysis. The following guiding principles applied by PwC formed the basis of the BRR conducted:
(i)
 Equitability of remuneration; 
(ii) Size and complexity of the businesses;
(iii) Market comparisons for competitiveness; 
(iv) Regulatory and risk;
(v) Sustainability and governance balance; and
(vi) Value/contribution to the organisation. 
Pursuant to the findings of the BRR exercise, PwC has recommended that the existing NED Remuneration Framework be revised as follows:

Act 2016 and Paragraph 7.24 of the Listing Requirements. 
B. EFFECTIVE AUDIT AND RISK MANAGEMENT
Internal Controls and Risk Management
The Group has a comprehensive system of internal controls in place, designed to ensure 
that risks are mitigated and that the Group’s objectives are attained. The Board recognises its responsibility to present a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the Group’s position and prospects. It is accountable for reviewing and approving the effectiveness of internal controls operated by the Group, including financial, operational and compliance controls, and risk management. The Board recognises its responsibility in respect of the Group’s risk management processes and system of internal controls, and oversees the activities of the Group’s external auditors and the Group’s risk management function which have been delegated to the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committees. 
During FY2023, the Audit Committee of the Board (ACB) reviewed Related Party Transactions 
(RPTs) to ensure that they are in compliance with Maybank Group’s procedures for identifying, monitoring, reporting and reviewing RPTs, in line with Maybank Group Policy on RPT and the Listing Requirements. Following the amendments to the Listing Requirements with regard to conflict of interest, the TOR of ACB was amended in June 2023 to reflect the enhanced role of ACB in this regard. With increased adoption of technology capabilities and the concomitant risk of cyber threats, information security and/or data breaches as well as information technology risk have been among the Group’s and/or Risk Management Committee’s key focus areas during FY2023. Technology infrastructure and security controls continue to be strengthened as guided by Maybank Group Cyber and Technology Risk Management Frameworks, and BNM’s Risk Management in Technology (RMiT) policy document.
Premised on the guiding principles of ESG risk management which are embedded in 
Maybank Group’s ESG Risk Management Framework, the Group periodically reviews and enhances its ESG practices by working with stakeholders to drive sustainable business activities. In enhancing our ESG practices, Maybank takes a proactive approach to incorporating ESG considerations into business processes in a meaningful way by developing ESG Risk Acceptance Criteria for high ESG risk industries.
  The Group’s risk governance structure and risk management approach are further discussed on 
pages 138 to 144. For details on the management and mitigation of each principal risk, see pages 48 to 54. Refer to pages 128 and 129 for further details on the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committees’ roles

Approach to Investor Relations (IR)
The Board recognises the importance of maintaining a purposeful relationship with 
shareholders. In this regard, the Group has a comprehensive Investor Relations programme to enable existing and potential shareholders and investors to understand its activities, strategy, financial performance and sustainability initiatives through timely and accurate dissemination of information to the investing community. This is done with the intention of allowing all domestic and international shareholders and investors to make informed investment decisions about Maybank. 
The President and Group CEO, the Group Chief Financial Officer and the Head of Group 
Investor Relations meet regularly with the Company’s existing and potential shareholders and investors to discuss the areas mentioned above and any of their other potential areas of interests. Arising from these discussions, the Board is kept updated on shareholders and investors’ feedback and areas of interest. The Board has also adopted the Group’s Corporate Disclosure Policies and Procedures (CDPP) to enhance transparency and accountability and facilitate disclosure of material information in a timely and accurate manner. The CDPP, which is available on Maybank Group’s corporate website, also indicates other designated spokespersons who are available to speak publicly on behalf of the Group.
IR Engagements
Broader key engagement activities conducted in FY2023 to keep shareholders and investors informed on Maybank’s material developments include the 63
rd AGM, Extraordinary General 
Meeting (EGM) and four quarterly results briefings with analysts while the public was engaged through press conferences held in conjunction with our half-yearly results announcements, AGM and EGM. Meanwhile, tailored FY2023 engagements with institutional shareholders and investors include dedicated management meetings, themed investor briefings on Community Financial Services, Global Banking and the Group’s digital strategy, approach and progress as well as senior management’s attendance in four conferences and non-deal roadshows, resulting in 128 analysts and fund managers from 73 companies met. Details on the investor relations engagements in FY2023 and areas of investor interest can be found in Investor Information on pages 82 to 85.
Further details on Maybank’s communication channels and the types of investor 
engagements undertaken by Maybank are detailed in the CDPP. All investor presentations and press releases by Maybank for the above IR engagements are available on Maybank Group’s corporate website at www.maybank.com/ir. Shareholders and investors can engage with the Group and provide feedback through the Investor Relations team, whose contact details are available on Maybank Group’s corporate website.
General Meetings

pg. 151-160 Figure 1: Group Risk StructureThis Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control has been prepared in accordance with paragraph 15.26(b) of Bursa Malaysia’s Main Market Listing Requirements (MMLR), which 
requires the board of directors to provide a statement in the annual report about the state of internal control of the listed issuer as a group. Accordingly, the Board of Directors of Maybank (referred to as “the Board”) is pleased to provide the following disclosure statement, which encapsulates key features of the Group’s risk management system and internal control during the year under review.
BOARD RESPONSIBILITY
The Board affirms its overall responsibility for establishing a sound risk management and internal control system, as well as for reviewing its adequacy and effectiveness in identifying, assessing and responding to risks that may hinder the Group from achieving its objectives.
One of the vital roles of the Board is to establish the 
Group’s risk appetite, which articulates the types and levels of risk that the Group is willing to accept in the pursuit of its business and strategic objectives. In this respect, the Board actively engages in the Group’s strategic goals and plans, ensuring that the corresponding risks are adequately mitigated within the approved risk appetite. In view of the inherent limitations in any risk management and internal control system, the Board recognises that such a system can only provide reasonable, rather than absolute, assurance against material financial misstatement, fraud or losses.
The Board plays a crucial role in establishing a robust 
risk management and internal control governance structure, which is critical in setting the tone and culture of effective risk management. To effectively execute its oversight responsibilities, the Board has established the Risk Management Committee (RMC), Compliance Committee of the Board (CCB), and Audit Committee of the Board (ACB). These committees are responsible for overseeing matters related to risk, compliance and controls, respectively, and periodically provide the Board with updates on their work, key deliberations and decisions on delegated matters.MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY
Senior management holds the responsibility for implementing all policies and procedures established by the Board pertaining to risk and control. The roles of senior management include:
•
 Identifying and evaluating risks relevant to the 
Group’s business, and the achievement of business 
objectives and strategies;
• Formulating relevant policies and procedures to manage these risks in accordance with the Group’s strategic vision and overall risk appetite;
•
 Designing, implementing and monitoring an effective risk management and internal control system;
•
 Implementing remedial actions to address compliance deficiencies as directed by the Board; and
•
 Reporting in a timely manner to the Board any 
changes to risks or emerging risks and the corrective and mitigation actions taken.

Financial year ended 31 December 2023 Figure 2: Principles of Risk AppetiteRisk Management Framework
Risk management has evolved into an important driver for strategic decisions in support of business strategies 
while balancing the appropriate levels of risk taken with the desired levels of returns. To complement this, Group Risk has developed the Maybank Group Enterprise Risk Management Framework to institutionalise vigilance and awareness of the most significant risks to the achievement of the Group’s mission, namely Humanising Financial Services, by putting customers and the wider community at the heart of everything that the Group does. The framework is underpinned by a set of building blocks that serves as the foundation in driving a strong risk management culture, encompassing the following practices and processes:Risk Appetite
The Group’s risk appetite is an integral component of the Group’s robust 
risk management framework and is driven by both top-down Board leadership and bottom-up involvement of Management at all levels. The risk appetite enables the Board and senior management to communicate and assess the types and levels of risk that the Group is willing to accept in pursuit of its business and strategic goals while taking into consideration the constraints under a stressed environment. The Group’s risk appetite translates our risk capacity into risk limits and/or tolerance as guidance, which are used regularly to measure and evaluate our risk profile.
The risk appetite is integrated into the strategic planning process, and 
remains dynamic and responsive to changing internal and external drivers such as business and market conditions, stakeholders’ expectations and internal capabilities. In addition, the Group’s annual budget is aligned with the risk appetite in ensuring that projected revenues arising from business transactions are consistent with the risk profiles established. The risk appetite also provides a consistent structure in understanding risk and is embedded in day-to-day business activities and decisions throughout the Group.
Risk Governance and Oversight
The governance model adopted by the Group provides a formalised, 
transparent and effective governance structure that promotes the active involvement of the Board and senior management in the risk management process to ensure a uniform view of risks across the Group.
Our governance model places accountability and ownership in ensuring 
appropriate levels of independence and segregation of duties between the three lines of defence. The management of risk takes place at different hierarchical levels and is emphasised through various levels of committees and business lines as well as control and reporting functions.

Risk Coverage
The Group must  
determine its business 
strategy and assess its  
risks to ensure appropriate 
risk strategies are put in 
place for greater  
assurance of achieving its 
business strategy.
Risk Appetite
The risk appetite defines the level 
of risk that the Group is willing to 
assume within its risk capacity to 
meet its overall strategic and 
business objectives while 
safeguarding against key 
sources of risk to the Group  
such as financial,  
operational and  
 reputation risk.Resources and System  
Infrastructure
Ensure sufficient resources, 
infrastructure and 
techniques are in place to 
enable effective risk 
management.
Stress Test
Stress testing is used  
to test the resilience of 
the Group’s exposure 
against future financial 
scenarios and gauge the 
resulting risk and 
adequacy of capital.
Risk Management 
Practices and Processes
Robust risk management 
processes are in place to 
actively identify, measure, 
control, monitor and report 
risks inherent in all products 
and activities undertaken  
by the Group.
Governance and  
Risk Oversight
There is a clear, effective 
and robust governance 
structure with well-defined, 
transparent and consistent 
lines of responsibility.Risk Response
Selection of the appropriate 
risk response is imperative 
to align all risks with the 
Group’s risk tolerance and 
risk appetite.

Risk and Compliance Culture
The risk and compliance culture is driven by a strong tone from the top. It serves as the foundation in which robust enterprise-wide risk management structures and governance are built. 
This is to ingrain the expected values and principles of conduct that shape the behaviour and attitude of employees at all levels of business and activity across the Group.
Risk and compliance policies are clearly defined, consistently communicated and continuously reinforced throughout the Group to embed a robust culture that cultivates active identification, 
assessment and mitigation of risks. As part of the risk and compliance culture, the Board, senior management and employees of the Group are committed to adhering to the requirements of relevant laws, rules and regulations. This commitment is clearly demonstrated through the establishment and strengthening of policies, processes and controls in managing and preventing non-compliance.
Risk and compliance culture programmes are emplaced and driven by the Board and senior management encompassing, among others, value capsules, induction programmes, 
engagement sessions, e-learning and roadshows. An integrated assurance platform is also emplaced to provide a single collective view of risk controls, compliance and governance. This ensures that risk considerations are embraced by all employees in enhancing the customer experience, building trust and brand value of the Group for long-term sustainability of the organisation.

with Shariah principles as well as to provide oversight accountabilities to the Board, Shariah Committee and other key organs involved in implementation of Shariah governance.
The Shariah Governance Framework reflects the responsibilities of the Board, Shariah 
Committee, senior management and Shariah control functions, namely Shariah Risk, Shariah Review and Shariah Audit, to ensure the effective management of Shariah non-compliance risks. The end-to-end Shariah-compliant governance mechanism is carried out through three lines of defence as follows:
•
 1st – Business and support units and Shariah Secretariat;
• 2nd – Shariah Risk and Shariah Review; and
• 3rd – Shariah Audit 
Stress Testing
The Group’s stress testing programme is embedded within the risk and capital management 
process and is also a key function of the business planning process. It serves as a forward-
looking tool to facilitate the understanding of risk profiles under exceptional but plausible 
events and worst-case scenarios that may arise due to various economic, political and/or environmental factors, as well as to ascertain their impact on the Group and how they can be proactively managed.
The Group is preparing for Bank Negara Malaysia’s 2024 climate risk stress testing (CRST) 
exercise. In anticipation of the 2024 CRST, we conducted a dry-run climate risk stress test on our Malaysian portfolio to support learning, enable a review of early climate stress test results and highlight areas of enhancement. There is a requirement by Otoritas Jasa Keuangan for PT Bank Maybank Indonesia Tbk to complete a climate risk stress test in 2024 for which the Group is providing support.
Responsible LendingOur long-term financial success depends on the ability to identify and address the 
environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks of our business, as well as to identify opportunities for our businesses and our customers to grow sustainably. Premised on the guiding principles embedded in the Maybank Group Sustainability Framework and Maybank Group ESG Risk Management Framework, we continuously review and enhance our ESG practices by working with our stakeholders to drive sustainable business activities.
To enhance our ESG practices, ESG considerations are incorporated into the Group’s credit 
risk policies and procedures documents as well as business processes through the development of position papers and ESG Risk Acceptance Criteria for industries with high ESG risk. Part of this process involves engagement with industry players and clients to promote understanding of ESG impacts and identify opportunities to integrate sustainability into clients’ business practices. Furthermore, a Client Engagement Guidebook enables our relationship managers to have meaningful ESG-related engagements with clients, build forward-looking strategic and operational thinking capabilities, and curate bespoke solutions to support their decarbonisation journeys. An ESG Screening Document, meanwhile, integrates ESG considerations into the deal evaluation process, allowing relationship managers, risk managers and/or decision makers to gauge the maturity of clients’ sustainability practices. In addition, the Sustainable Product Framework promotes more effective development of sustainable solutions, while the Transition Finance Framework provides guardrails on the mobilisation of transition finance for hard-to-abate sectors. Furthermore, the Maybank Group Climate Risk Policy provides principle-based requirements for climate risk management, with the intention of achieving climate resilience.
  Details of the Frameworks can be found in the Sustainability Report and Environmental Report which 
are available on www.maybank.com/ar or www.maybank.com/en/sustainability.pageCompliance Framework
The Framework provides the key principles and guidelines for managing compliance risk 
within the Group. It serves as a guide for the Compliance function alongside the Board, senior management and all employees in all jurisdictions in understanding and managing compliance risk. It is adopted and implemented by operating entities across the Group.
The Framework outlines:•
 The overarching principles for the management of compliance risk across the Group;
• The overall strategy for managing compliance risk to ensure uniformity in practices 
across the Group in meeting regulatory and legal obligations;
• The minimum expected standards for compliance risk management; and
• The roles and responsibilities of compliance risk management across the Group.
Shariah Governance Framework
Maybank Group’s Shariah Governance Framework sets out the expectations for effective 
Shariah governance structures, processes and arrangements of all businesses and countries within the Group that execute Islamic business transactions. The Framework was established in accordance with Bank Negara Malaysia’s Shariah Governance Policy Document. This is to Risk Management Practices and Processes
The risk management practices and processes enable systematic identification, measurement, 
control, monitoring and reporting of risk exposures across the Group.
Identification• Identify, understand and assess risks inherent in products, activities and business initiatives.
•
 Enable early detection of risk and ensure sound risk management practices are in place to manage and control product risk.
Measurement• Develop risk measurement techniques across different dimensions of risk factors to ensure continual reassessment and identification of risks.
•
 Measure aggregate exposure of the Group, individual business and country, the risk types as well as the short and long-term impact of the exposures.
•
 Adopt forward-looking approach in identifying emerging risks to ensure appropriate steps are taken to minimise Group’s exposure.
Controls• Establish quantitative and qualitative controls including risk limits, thresholds and triggers to oversee and manage the risk exposures 
identified.
•
 Implement risk mitigation techniques aimed at minimising existing or, in some instances, preventing new or emerging risks from occurring.
Monitoring  
and Reporting• Monitor forward-looking key risk indicators and early warning signals to ensure sufficient and timely action to mitigate any potential risk to the Group.
•
 Report the state of compliance to senior management-level and Board-level risk committees as well as to the Board on a regular basis.

The Cyber Risk Management Framework has been established based on standards issued 
by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and guidance issued by regulatory bodies, ensuring operational resilience against extreme but plausible cyber-attacks. It is structured to identify the risks, build resiliency, continue evolving our mechanisms in detecting cyber threats and responding effectively to cyber related events. The framework covers both business and technology drivers from an end-to-end perspective. It is able to support the effective identification, protection, detection, response and recovery of systems and data hosted on premise.
The Technology Risk Management Framework implements a comprehensive approach 
towards governing and managing risks in the domains of technology risk for the Group. It establishes the governance and oversight structure and risk management processes on how technology risk will be identified, assessed, monitored, responded to and communicated, including roles and responsibilities.
Both frameworks are in place to ensure that our deliverables are aligned with the financial 
services industry’s recommended practices and regulatory requirements. They have also been designed to be living documents, and to grow with the Group in the areas of cyber defence and technology development, application and system deliverables, management of outsourced service providers and awareness of cyber hygiene among our stakeholders.
INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMKey elements of the internal control system established by the Board to provide effective 
governance and oversight of internal controls include: 
•
 Group Organisation Structure

Any changes or amendments to the Group’s policies are also tabled to the Board for approval. 
•
 Oversight by Audit Committee of the Board
The Audit Committee of the Board (ACB) has been established by the Board to assist in the execution of its governance and oversight responsibilities, as well as to ensure that there is a reliable and transparent financial reporting process within the Group. ACB’s 
responsibilities include assessing the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s governance, risk management and internal control systems through the Internal Audit (IA) function. The ACB has active oversight of the independence, scope of work and resources of the IA. The ACB meticulously reviews both internal and external audit plans, scrutinises control mechanisms, addresses weaknesses, and verifies financial statements for accuracy and compliance. Furthermore, the ACB plays a pivotal role in appointing and evaluating the Group Chief Audit Executive and external auditor, safeguarding audit objectivity; and upholding ethical conduct through conflict of interest review. The committee meets periodically to review audit and investigation reports prepared by IA, taking into consideration the corresponding Group Internal Audit Committee (GIAC)’s deliberation of the same reports. Significant control lapses are escalated by the ACB to the Board for further deliberation, where necessary. As for unresolved audit findings, the ACB deliberates on them and ensures that Management undertakes the necessary remedial actions within the stipulated timeline. 
  Details of the activities undertaken by the ACB are highlighted in the Audit Committee Report as 
set out on pages 145 to 149

IA’s processes and activities are guided by the Audit Charter and governed by relevant regulatory guidelines, the Group’s Code of Ethics and mandatory guidance outlined within the International Professional Practices Framework established by The Institute of Internal Auditors.
   More detailed description of the Internal Audit function 
is highlighted in the Audit Committee Report on pages 145 to 146
This statement has been reviewed by our external auditor in pursuance 
of paragraph 15.23 of the Listing Requirements for inclusion in the annual report of the Group for the financial year ended 31 December 2023. The limited assurance review was conducted in accordance with Audit and Assurance Practice Guide 3 (AAPG3) issued by the Malaysian Institute of Accountants. The AAPG3 does not require external auditors to form an opinion on the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management and internal control systems of the Group. 
Based on the limited assurance procedures performed and evidence 
obtained, the external auditor has reported to the Board that nothing has come to their attention that causes them to believe that this statement, intended to be included in the annual report, has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the disclosures required by paragraphs 41 and 42 of the Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control: Guidelines for Directors of Listed Issuers; nor is the statement factually inaccurate.
The President and Group CEO and Group Chief Financial Officer have provided reasonable assurance to the Board that the risk management and internal control system implemented by the Group is operating adequately and effectively in all material aspects.
As for the material associate companies, an associate is defined as 
an entity over which the Group and the Bank have significant influence. Significant influence refers to the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, although it does not constitute control or joint control over those policies.
After careful consideration of the assurance from senior management 
and input from relevant assurance providers, the Board is of the view that the Group’s risk management and internal control system operates adequately and effectively, thus safeguarding the interests of the Group’s shareholders and assets. Additionally, the Board is satisfied that the Group has established an ongoing process to identify, evaluate, monitor, manage and respond to significant risks encountered in the pursuit of its business and strategic objectives. This commitment remains amid the dynamic and challenging business environment and increasing regulatory scrutiny, especially in these times of uncertainty and crisis. This process has been consistently in place throughout the entire financial year under review, up to the date of approval of the statement for inclusion in the annual report.REVIEW OF THE STATEMENT BY EXTERNAL AUDITOR

INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION
ORGANISATIONAL INDEPENDENCE
The IA function of Maybank was established by the Board to provide independent and 
objective assurance of the adequacy and effectiveness of the governance, risk management, anti-corruption, whistle-blowing and internal control processes implemented by the Management. The function is independent of the activities audited and from the day-to-day internal control processes. The GCAE reports functionally to the ACB and administratively to the President and Group CEO to maintain the requisite independence and objectivity as outlined in the Audit Charter approved by the Board. The IA function of Maybank, including the Malaysia and overseas subsidiaries and branches, are organised on a Group basis under the purview of the GCAE. The GCAE has active oversight of the in-house IA functions of the overseas subsidiaries in the Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Thailand and Vietnam which, in turn, are directly accountable to their respective entities’ ACBs (or equivalent). To maintain audit objectivity and independence, the IA functions in Malaysia as well as the overseas entities are independent of the operations of the other operating units.
The IA function of the Group is led by Mohamad Yasin Abdullah. He has more than 26 years 
of experience in the corporate and financial industry, of which 12 years were in the capacity of Chief Financial Officer and four years of Chief Operating Officer. He is a Chartered Banker with the Asian Institute of Chartered Bankers and a Fellow Member of The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (FCCA) and The Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (FCMA). He is also a member of The Malaysian Institute of Certified Public Accountants (MICPA) and the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (MIA). He graduated from the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) with a Bachelor of Accounting (Honours) and a Master of Business Administration in Finance. He is a member of the Board of Governors of The IIA Malaysia and is also an active member of the Chief Internal Auditors Networking Group (CIANG).RESPONSIBILITY, SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY
The principal responsibility of the IA function is to evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness 
of the system of risk management and internal control implemented by the Group and to assess whether risks that may hinder the Group from achieving its objectives are adequately evaluated, managed and controlled. It provides risk-based and objective assurance, advice and insight to enhance and protect organisational value and assist management to achieve its objectives. 
The AAP FY2023 was approved by the ACB in January 2023. It defined the IA scope of work 
for the year, covering the business and operations of the Group. In establishing the plan, all the auditable units were risk ranked using the Maybank Risk-Based Audit approach while the COSO Internal Control - Integrated Framework Principles and COBIT (for IT) framework were used to assess the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls. The AAP also took into consideration the Group’s key business strategies and operations, and Management’s feedback on their areas of concern and potential risks. In addition, MGA continued to provide independent and objective consultative reviews of the implementation of new initiatives in the Group during the year including new business ventures, new systems, and the introduction of new products.
IA’s processes and activities are governed by the relevant regulatory guidelines as well as 
the Group’s future-ready Code of Ethics and Conduct Policy and mandatory guidance of the International Professional Practices Framework issued by The IIA. During the year, audit reports, along with the issues, root causes and recommendations as well as Management’s responses and action plans for improvement and/or rectification, were tabled to the GIAC and ACB for review and deliberation. The rectification status of the audit findings was closely tracked and periodically reported to the GIAC and ACB to ensure prompt resolution. Any requests for rectification timeline extension were also tabled to the ACB for approval.
The Quality Assurance and Improvement Programme (QAIP) continues to be used to assess 
the quality of the audit processes against international standards promulgated by The IIA. Recommendations and opportunities for improvement are identified through internal and external assessments. The internal assessment is performed annually by an independent internal quality assurance team under the direct supervision of the GCAE, while the external assessment is conducted at least once every five years by a qualified and independent external assessor. The QAIP results are tabled to the ACB. 
RESOURCESThe overall costs incurred for maintaining the IA function in the Group for FY2023 was 
approximately RM94.38 million. The breakdown of staff strength and expenses incurred is as follows: 
Location No. of Staff RM’ Million
Malaysia 142 45.52

accessible and flexible learning alternatives. A comprehensive series of in-house training sessions, both in virtual and physical mode, was conducted by subject matter specialists from MGA and Maybank’s line trainers to provide auditors with essential audit and technical knowledge in various audit areas. Where applicable, the training sessions were extended virtually to the overseas IA teams to ensure consistency in the application of auditing standards, processes, practices and testing procedures. Externally, the auditors also actively participated in conferences, webinars and training programmes organised by accredited training providers and professional bodies.
In October 2023, a survey aligned with the Internal Auditor Competencies Framework 
established by The IIA was conducted. This survey aimed to assess skillsets within MGA, providing valuable insights into the diversity and strength of available skills while also addressing the learning needs of the IA functions.
MGA remains committed to the continual upskilling of the auditors, by enabling the auditors 
to advance through relevant internal audit certifications, including the Specialist Certificate in Bank Audit, Certified Internal Auditors, Certified Information Systems Auditor and Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists, and other relevant certifications. This commitment serves to further enhance the auditors’ competencies and support their continuous professional development.
SUMMARY OF INTERNAL AUDIT ACTIVITIES IN FY2023 
In reference to the ACB’s activities in relation to IA as stated in paragraphs 1 to 18 above, IA had also undertaken the following initiatives throughout 2023 to support the ACB in the discharge of its functions and duties:
1.
 Continued to transform and accelerate the application of digital technologies in 
auditing to provide better insights into determining emerging risks with the robust 
succession of data and advanced analytics. The key enhancements and evolution were 
on incorporating robotic process automation in most assurance functions as well as leveraging data and analytics to support IA’s assurance and advisory roles to Management and stakeholders.
2.
 Conducted a four-day Group-wide onsite AAP challenge session to calibrate and integrate the audit approach across all IA functions in Malaysia and overseas entities. This was to ensure consistent and comprehensive coverage of risk locations across the Group. 
3.
 Performed periodic internal control testing and independent assessment on business units, operations and processes across the Group as identified in the AAP. Among the key risk areas assessed were environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives, cyber and technology security, anti-money laundering, anti-bribery and corruption, outsourcing governance and operations as well as sales activities, cash management and physical security at branches.4.
